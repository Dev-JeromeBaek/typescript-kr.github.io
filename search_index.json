TypeScript)\nTypeScript를 설치하는 방법은 크게 두가지입니다:\n\nNPM을 통해 설치 (Node.js 패키지 매니저)\nTypeScript의 Visual Studio 플러그인 설치\n\nVisual Studio 2017 및 Visual Studio 2015 Update 3에는 기본적으로 TypeScript가 포함되어 있습니다.\nVisual Studio와 함꼐 TypeScript를 설치하지 않았다면 다운로드할 수 있습니다.\nNPM 사용자의 경우:\n> npm install -g typescript\n\n첫번째 TypeScript 파일 만들기 (Building your first TypeScript file)\n편집기에서 greeter.ts파일을 만들고 다음 JavaScript 코드를 입력하십시오:\nfunction greeter(person) {\n    return \"Hello, \" + person;\n}\n\nlet user = \"Jane User\";\n\ndocument.body.innerHTML = greeter(user);\n\n코드 컴파일하기 (Compiling your code)\n우리는 .ts 확장자를 사용했지만, 이 코드는 그냥 자바스크립트입니다.\n기존 자바스크립트 앱에서 바로 복사 / 붙여넣기 할 수 있습니다.\n명령줄에서 TypeScript 컴파일러를 실행합니다:\ntsc greeter.ts\n\n결과는 동일한 자바스크립트를 포함하고있는 gretter.js 파일이 될 것입니다.\nJavaScript 애플리케이션에서 TypeScript를 실행 중입니다!\n이제 TypeScript가 제공하는 새로운 기능들을 활용할 수 있습니다.\n다음과 같이 'person' 함수의 인수에 : string 타입 어노테이션을 추가하십시오:\nfunction greeter(person: string) {\n    return \"Hello, \" + person;\n}\n\nlet user = \"Jane User\";\n\ndocument.body.innerHTML = greeter(user);\n\n타입 어노테이션 (Type annotations)\nTypeScript의 타입 어노테이션은 함수 또는 변수의 의도된 계약을 적는 간단한 방법입니다.\n이 경우 greeter 함수를 단일 문자열 매개변수로 호출하려고 합니다.\n여기서 우리는 greeter 함수에 문자열 대신 배열을 전달하여 호출할 수도 있을 것입니다:\nfunction greeter(person: string) {\n    return \"Hello, \" + person;\n}\n\nlet user = [0, 1, 2];\n\ndocument.body.innerHTML = greeter(user);\n\n다시 컴파일하면, 오류가 표시됩니다.\nerror TS2345: Argument of type 'number[]' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.\n\n마찬가지로, gretter를 호출할 때 모든 인수를 제거해보십시오.\nTypeScript는 예상치 못한 매개변수로 함수를 호출했다는 것을 알려줍니다.\n두 경우 모두 TypeScript는 코드 구조와 사용자가 제공한 타입 어노테이션을 기반으로 정적 분석을 제공할 수 있습니다.\n에러가 있었음에도 불구하고, greeter.js 파일은 여전히 생성됩니다.\n코드에 오류가 있어도 TypeScript를 사용할 수 있습니다. 그러나 이 경우에 TypeScript는 코드가 예상대로 실행되지 않을 것이라고 경고합니다.\n인터페이스 (Interfaces)\n예제를 더 발전시켜 봅시다. 여기서는 firstName 및 lastName 필드가 있는 객체를 설명하는 인터페이스를 사용합니다.\nTypeSciprt에서는 두가지 타입이 내부 구조가 호환되면 호환됩니다.\n이것은 명시적으로 implements 구문 없이 인터페이스가 요구하는 형태를 가짐으로써 인터페이스를 구현할 수 있게 해줍니다.\ninterface Person {\n    firstName: string;\n    lastName: string;\n}\n\nfunction greeter(person: Person) {\n    return \"Hello, \" + person.firstName + \" \" + person.lastName;\n}\n\nlet user = { firstName: \"Jane\", lastName: \"User\" };\n\ndocument.body.innerHTML = greeter(user);\n\n클래스 (Classes)\n마지막으로 클래스를 사용하여 예제를 확장해 보겠습니다.\nTypeScript는 클래스 기반 객체 지향 프로그래밍과 같은 JavaScript의 새로운 기능을 지원합니다.\n여기서는 생성자와 몇 개의 public 필드를 사용하여 Student 클래스를 생성 할 것입니다.\n클래스와 인터페이스가 잘 작동하여 프로그래머가 올바른 수준의 추상화를 결정할 수 있습니다.\n또한 생성자에 대한 인수에 public 을 사용하는 것은 그 이름으로 속성을 자동으로 생성 할 수 있는 단축형태입니다.\nclass Student {\n    fullName: string;\n    constructor(public firstName: string, public middleInitial: string, public lastName: string) {\n        this.fullName = firstName + \" \" + middleInitial + \" \" + lastName;\n    }\n}\n\ninterface Person {\n    firstName: string;\n    lastName: string;\n}\n\nfunction greeter(person : Person) {\n    return \"Hello, \" + person.firstName + \" \" +

설정이 기본적으로 변경되지 않은 브라우저로 전송되는 것을 의미합니다.\n먼저 browserify, tsify 및 vinyl-source-stream을 설치하십시오.tsify는 gulp-typescript처럼 Typeify 컴파일러에 접근할 수 있는 Browserify 플러그인입니다.vinyl-source-stream을 사용하면 Browserify의 파일

플러그인으로 Browserify를 호출하도록 변경했습니다.편리하게도 둘 모두 TypeScript 컴파일러에 동일한 options 객체를 전달할 수 있습니다.\nbundle을 호출한 후 source(vinil-source-stream에 대한 별칭)를 사용하여 출력 번들 bundle.js의 이름을 지정합니다.\ngulp를 실행하고 브라우저에서 dist/index.html을 열어 페이지를 테스트하십시오.페이지에 \"Hello from TypeScript\"가 표시되어야 합니다.\nBrowserify에 debug : true를 지정한 것에 주목하십시오.이로 인해 tsify는 번들 JavaScript 파일 내에서 소스맵을 내보냅니다.소스 맵을 사용하면 번들로 제공된 JavaScript 대신 브라우저에서 원본 TypeScript 코드를 디버깅할 수 있습니다.브라우저의 디버거를 열고 main.ts 안에 브레이크포인트을 넣으면 소스 맵이 작동하는지 테스트할 수 있습니다.페이지를 새로 고침 할 때 브레이크포인트가 페이지를 일시 중지하고 greet.ts를 디버깅 할 수 있도록 해야 합니다.\nWatchify, Babel, and Uglify\n이제 코드를 Browserify에 묶어서 tsify 했으므로 browserify 플러그인을 사용하여 빌드에 다양한 기능을 추가할 수 있습니다.\n\nWatchify가 gulp를 계속 실행하며 파일을 저장할 때마다 점차적으로 컴파일합니다.이를 통해 브라우저에서 편집-저장-새로고침 사이클을 계속 진행할 수 있습니다.\n\nBabel은 ES2015 이상을 ES5 및 ES3으로 변환하는 매우 유연한 컴파일러입니다.따라서 TypeScript에서 지원하지 않는 광범위한 맞춤형 변환을 추가할 수 있습니다.\n\nUglify는 다운로드 시간을 줄이도록 코드를 압축합니다.\n\n\nWatchify\nWatchify로 백그라운드 컴파일을 시작하겠습니다 :\nnpm install --save-dev watchify

코드를 약간 리팩토링해야합니다.\n\nwatchify에 대한 호출에서 browserify 인스턴스를 감싸고 그 결과를 유지했습니다.\nwatchedBrowserify.on(\"update\", bundle);을 호출하여 Browserify 가 TypeScript 파일 중 하나가 변경될 때마다 bundle 함수를 실행하도록 했습니다.\nwatchedBrowserify.on(\"log\", gutil.log);을 호출하여 콘솔에 로그했습니다.\n\n(1)과 (2)는 default 작업에서 browserify를 호출해야 한다는 것을 의미합니다.Watchify와 Gulp 모두 호출해야 하기 때문에 default 함수에 이름을 주어야 합니다.(3)을 사용한 로깅을 추가하는 것은 선택 사항이지만 설정을 디버깅하는 데 매우 유용합니다.\n이제 Gulp를 실행하면 시작해야 하고 계속 실행됩니다.main.ts에서 showHello에 대한 코드를 변경하고 저장하십시오.  \n다음과 같은 출력이 표시되어야 합니다 :\nproj$ gulp\n[10:34:20] Using gulpfile ~/src/proj/gulpfile.js\n[10:34:20]

합니다.\nnpm install --save-dev gulp-uglify vinyl-buffer gulp-sourcemaps\n\n이제 gulpfile을 다음과 같이 변경하십시오 :\nvar gulp = require(\"gulp\");\nvar browserify = require(\"browserify\");\nvar source = require('vinyl-source-stream');\nvar tsify = require(\"tsify\");\nvar uglify = require('gulp-uglify');\nvar sourcemaps = require('gulp-sourcemaps');\nvar buffer = require('vinyl-buffer');\nvar paths =

.pipe(gulp.dest(\"dist\"));\n});\n\nuglify 자체에는 하나의 호출만 있습니다 — buffer와 sourcemaps에 대한 호출은 sourcemaps이 계속 작동하는지 확인하기 위해 존재합니다.이러한 호출을 통해 이전과 같이 인라인 소스 맵을 사용하는 대신 별도의 소스 맵 파일을 사용할 수 있습니다.이제 Gulp를 실행하고 bundle.js가 난독화로 압축되는지 확인하십시오 :\ngulp\ncat dist/bundle.js\n\nBabel\n먼저 ES2015 전용 Babelify 및 Babel preset을 설치하십시오.Uglify처럼 Babelify도 코드를 엉망으로 만들기 때문에 vinyl-buffer와 gulp-sourcemaps이 필요합니다.기본적으로 Babelify는

JavaScript.html","title":"JavaScript에서 마이그레이션","keywords":"","body":"TypeScript는 공백 상태로 존재하지 않습니다.JavaScript 생태계를 염두에 두고 만들어졌으며 오늘날에는 많은 JavaScript가 존재합니다.JavaScript 코드 베이스를 TypeScript로 변환하는 것은 다소 지루하지만 보통 어렵지 않습니다.이 튜토리얼에서는 시작하는 방법을 살펴보겠습니다.새로운 TypeScript 코드를 작성하기에 충분한 핸드북을 읽은 것으로 가정합니다.\nReact 프로젝트를 변환하려는 경우 React Conversion Guide를 먼저 참조하는 것이 좋습니다.\n디렉터리 설정하기 (Setting up your Directories)\n평범한 JavaScript로 작성하는 경우 JavaScript가 src와 lib 또는 dist 디렉터리에 있는 .js 파일을 직접 실행하고 원하는 대로 실행할 수 있습니다.\n이런 경우 작성한 파일은 TypeScript의 입력으로 사용되며 생성된 출력을 실행하게 됩니다.JS에서 TS로 마이그레이션 하는 동안 TypeScript가 입력 파일을 덮어쓰지 않도록 입력 파일을 분리해야 합니다.출력 파일이 특정 디렉터리에 있어야 하는 경우 해당 파일이 출력 디렉터리가 됩니다.\n번들링이나 Babel과 같은 다른 트랜스파일러를 사용하는 것과 같이 JavaScript에서 중간 단계를 수행할 수도 있습니다.이런 경우에는 이와 같은 폴더 구조가 이미 설정되어 있을 수 있습니다.\n지금부터 디렉터리가 다음과 같이 설정되었다고 가정할 것입니다:\nprojectRoot\n├── src\n│   ├── file1.js\n│   └── file2.js\n├── built\n└── tsconfig.json\n\nsrc 디렉터리 밖에 tests 폴더가 있다면 src에 tsconfig.json와 tests에 하나씩 가질 수 있습니다.\n설정 파일 작성하기 (Writing a Configuration File)\nTypeScript는 tsconfig.json이라는 파일을 사용하여 포함시킬 파일과 검사의 종류와 같은 프로젝트의 옵션을 관리합니다.프로젝트에 사용할 기본적인 뼈대를 생성하겠습니다:\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"outDir\": \"./built\",\n        \"allowJs\": true,\n        \"target\": \"es5\"\n    },\n    \"include\": [\n        \"./src/**/*\"\n    ]\n}\n\n여기서 TypeScript에 몇 가지를 지정합니다:\n\nsrc 디렉터리에의 모든 파일을 읽습니다 (include 포함)\nJavaScript 파일의 입력으로 허용합니다 (allowJs 포함)\nbuiltd에 모든 출력 파일을 내 보냅니다 (outDir와 함께)\n최신 JavaScript 구문을 ECMAScript 5 같은 이전 버전으로 변환합니다 (target 사용)\n\n이때 프로젝트 루트에 tsc를 실행하려고 하면 built 디렉터리에 출력 파일이 표시됩니다.built에 있는 파일의 레이아웃은 src의 레이아웃과 동일해야 합니다.이제 프로젝트에서 TypeScript로 작업해야 합니다.\n초기의 혜택 (Early Benefits)\n이 시점에서도 TypeScript에서 프로젝트를 이해함으로써 몇 가지 뛰어난 이점을 누릴 수 있습니다.VS Code나 Visual Studio 같은 편집기로 시작하면 자동 완성과 같은 도구 지원을 자주 받을 수 있습니다.또한 다음과 같은 옵션을 사용하여 특정 버그를 발견할 수도 있습니다:\n\nnoImplicitReturns는 함수의 끝에 반환문을 빼먹는 것을 방지합니다.\nnoFallthroughCasesInSwitch는 switch블록 case 사이에 break문을 뻬먹지 않기 위해 유용합니다.\n\nTypeScript는 도달 할 수없는 코드와 라벨에 대해서도 경고합니다.이 코드와 라벨은 각각의 allowUnreachableCode와 allowUnusedLabels로 해제할 수 있습니다.\n빌드 도구와 통합 (Integrating with Build Tools)\n파이프 라인에 빌드 단계가 더 있을 수 있습니다.아마도 각 파일에 무언가를 연결했을 것입니다.각 빌드 도구는 다르지만 각 빌드 도구의 요점을 다루기 위해 최선을 다할 것입니다.\nGulp\nGulp를 사용하는 경우 TypeScript로 Gulp 사용하기 튜토리얼이 있고 Browserify와 Babelify 그리고 Uglify와 같은 일반적인 빌드 도구와 통합됩니다.거기서 더 읽을 수 있습니다.\nWebpack\nWebpack 통합은 매우 간단합니다.\nTypeScript 로더인 awesome-typescript-loader를 source-map-loader와 결합하여 사용하면 디버깅이 쉬워 집니다.  \n간단한 실행\nnpm install awesome-typescript-loader source-map-loader\n\n그리고 다음의 옵션을 webpack.config.js 파일에 병합하십시오 :\nmodule.exports = {\n    entry: \"./src/index.ts\",\n    output: {\n        filename: \"./dist/bundle.js\",\n    },\n\n    // webpack의 출력을 디버깅 할 소스 맵을 사용하도록 설정합니다.\n    devtool: \"source-map\",\n\n    resolve: {\n        // 확인 가능한 확장자로 '.ts' 및 '.tsx'를 추가합니다.\n        extensions: [\"\", \".webpack.js\", \".web.js\", \".ts\", \".tsx\", \".js\"]\n    },\n\n    module: {\n        loaders: [\n            // '.ts' 또는 '.tsx' 확장자를 가진 모든 파일은 'awesome-typescript-loader'에 의해 처리됩니다.\n            { test: /\\.tsx?$/, loader: \"awesome-typescript-loader\" }\n        ],\n\n        preLoaders: [\n            // '.js' 파일의 모든 출력에는 'source-maps-loader'로 다시 처리된 소스 맵이 있습니다.\n            { test: /\\.js$/, loader: \"source-map-loader\" }\n        ]\n    },\n\n    // 다른 옵션들...\n};\n\n.js 파일을 다루는 다른 로더보다 awesome-typescript-loader를 먼저 실행해야 한다는 점에 주의해야 합니다.Webpack을 위한 TypeScript 로더인 ts-loader도 마찬가지입니다.여기에서. 그 둘의 차이점에 대해 더 읽어볼 수 있다. \nReact and Webpack에 관한 튜토리얼에서 Webpack을 사용하는 예를 볼 수 있습니다.\nTypeScript 파일로 이동 (Moving to TypeScript Files)\n이때 TypeScript 파일을 사용할 준비가 된 것입니다.첫 번째 단계는 .js 파일 중 하나의 이름을 .ts로 바꾸는 것입니다.파일이 JSX를 사용한다면 이름을 .tsx로 바꿔야 합니다.\n그 단계를 끝냈나요?\n좋았어!JavaScript에서 TypeScript로 파일을 성공적으로 마이그레이션 했습니다!\n물론 옳다고 생각하지 않을 수도 있습니다.TypeScript를 지원하는 편집기에서 해당 파일을 열면 (또는 tsc --pretty를 실행하면) 특정 라인에 빨간 줄이 나타날 수 있습니다.Microsoft Word와 같은 편집기에서 빨간 줄을 생각하는 것과 같은 방식으로 생각해야합니다.Word에서 여전히 문서를 인쇄할 수 있는 것처럼 TypeScript는 코드를 변환합니다.\n그 경고가 너무 느슨하면 그 경고를 엄격하게 할 수 있습니다.예를 들어 오류 발생으로 인해 TypeScript에서 JavaScript로 컴파일하는 것을 원치 않는 경우 noEmitOnError 옵션을 사용할 수 있습니다.그런 의미에서 TypeScript는 엄격함을 조절할 수 있는 도구를 가지고 있으며 원하는 만큼 조절할 수 있습니다.\n만약 사용 가능한 더 엄격한 설정을 사용할 계획이라면 지금 바로 설정하는 것이 가장 좋습니다.(아래의 Getting Stricter Checks 참조).\n예를 들어 TypeScript가 타입에 대해 any를 추론하지 않도록 명시하려면 파일을 수정하기 전에 noImplicitAny를 사용할 수 있습니다.다소 벅차다고 느껴질 수도 있지만 장기적 이득은 훨씬 더 빨리 나타납니다.\n오류 잡기 (Weeding out Errors)\n앞서 언급 한 것처럼 변환 후에 오류 메시지가 표시되는 것은 예상치 못한 일이 아닙니다.중요한 것은 이런 것들을 하나씩 살펴보고 어떻게 오류를 처리할 것인지를 결정하는 것입니다.종종 이것들은 문제없는 버그가 될 수도 있지만 때로는 TypeScript를 위해 조금 더 나은 것을 설명해야 할 것입니다.\n모듈 가져오기 (Importing from Modules)\nCannot find name 'require'.와 Cannot find name 'define'. 같은 오류가 발생하기 시작할 수 있습니다.이러한 경우 모듈을 사용하고 있을 가능성이 높습니다.\nTypeScript로 작성하는 동안 확실할 수 있지만\n// Node/CommonJS를 위한\ndeclare function require(path: string): any;\n\n또는\n// RequireJS/AMD를 위한\ndeclare function define(...args: any[]): any;\n\n이러한 호출들은 제거하고 import에 TypeScript 구문을 사용하는 것이 좋습니다.\n먼저 TypeScript의 module 플래그를 설정하여 일부 모듈 시스템을 활성화해야 합니다.유효한 옵션은commonjs,amd,system 그리고 umd입니다.\n다음 Node/CommonJS 코드를 가지고 있는 경우:\nvar foo = require(\"foo\");\n\nfoo.doStuff();\n\n또는 다음 RequireJS / AMD 코드:\ndefine([\"foo\"], function(foo) {\n    foo.doStuff();\n})\n\n그러면 다음과 같은 TypeScript 코드를 작성하게 됩니다:\nimport foo = require(\"foo\");\n\nfoo.doStuff();\n\n선언 파일 가져 오기 (Getting Declaration Files)\nTypeScript로 전환하기 시작하면 Cannot find module 'foo'.과 같은 오류가 발생할 수 있습니다.여기서 문제는 라이브러리를 설명할 수 있는 선언 파일(declaration files) 을 가지고 있지 않다는 것입니다.다행히도 이것은 꽤 쉽습니다.TypeScript에서 lodash와 같은 패키지에 대해 불평하는 경우 그냥 작성할 수 있습니다.\nnpm install -S @types/lodash\n\ncommonjs가 아닌 다른 모듈 옵션을 사용한다면 moduleResolution 옵션을 node로 설정해야 합니다.\n그런 다음 문제없이 Lodash를 가져올 수 있으며 자동 완성을 얻을 수 있습니다.\n모듈 내보내기 (Exporting from Modules)\n전형적으로 모듈에서 내보내기는 exports 나 module.exports와 같은 값에 프로퍼티를 추가하는 것을 포함합니다.TypeScript를 사용하면 최상위 레벨 내보내기 명령문을 허용할 수 있습니다.\n예를 들어 이와 같은 함수를 내보낸 경우:\nmodule.exports.feedPets = function(pets) {\n    // ...\n}\n\n다음과 같이 작성할 수 있습니다:\nexport function feedPets(pets) {\n    // ...\n}\n\n때로는 exports 객체를 완전히 덮어쓰기도 합니다.\n이것은 모듈을 이 코드처럼 즉시 호출 가능한 모듈로 만들기 위해 사용하는 일반적인 패턴입니다:\nvar express = require(\"express\");\nvar app = express();\n\n이전에는 이렇게 작성했을 수도 있습니다 :\nfunction foo() {\n    // ...\n}\nmodule.exports = foo;\n\nTypeScript에서는 이것을 export = 구조로 모델링할 수 있습니다.\nfunction foo() {\n    // ...\n}\nexport = foo;\n\n너무 많거나 적은 인수 (Too many/too few arguments)\n때때로 너무나 많거나 적은 인수를 가진 함수를 호출할 때가 있습니다.전형적으로 이것은 버그이지만 어떤 경우에는 매개 변수를 쓰는 대신 arguments 객체를 사용하는 함수를 선언했을 수도 있습니다:\nfunction myCoolFunction() {\n    if (arguments.length == 2 && !Array.isArray(arguments[1])) {\n        var f = arguments[0];\n        var arr = arguments[1];\n        // ...\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n\nmyCoolFunction(function(x) { console.log(x) }, [1, 2, 3, 4]);\nmyCoolFunction(function(x) { console.log(x) }, 1, 2, 3, 4);\n\n이런 경우에는 TypeScript를 사용하여 myCoolfunction이 함수 오버로드를 통해 호출될 수 있는 방법에 대해 알려주어야 합니다.\nfunction myCoolFunction(f: (x: number) => void, nums: number[]): void;\nfunction myCoolFunction(f: (x: number) => void, ...nums: number[]): void;\nfunction myCoolFunction() {\n    if (arguments.length == 2 && !Array.isArray(arguments[1])) {\n        var f = arguments[0];\n        var arr = arguments[1];\n        // ...\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n\nmyCoolFunction에 두 개의 오버로드를 추가했습니다.\n첫 번째 검사는 myCoolFunction가 (number를 갖는) 함수에 number의 목록을 가집니다.\n두번째는 함수도 갖춰야 한다는 것이고 그 뒤에 오는 인수가 숫자여야 한다는 것을 알리기 위해 나머지 매개변수(...nums)를 사용합니다.\n순차적으로 추가되는 프로퍼티 (Sequentially Added Properties)\n어떤 사람들은 다음과 같이 즉시 객체를 생성하고 속성을 추가하는 것이 더 예술적으로 즐겁다는 것을 알게됩니다:\nvar options = {};\noptions.color = \"red\";\noptions.volume = 11;\n\nTypeScript는 options의 타입을 어떠한 프로퍼티도 갖지 않는 {}로 먼저 찾아냈기 때문에 volume과 color에 할당할 수 없다고 말할 것입니다.대신 선언을 객체 리터럴 자체로 옮기면 오류가 발생하지 않습니다:\nlet options = {\n    color: \"red\",\n    volume: 11\n};\n\noptions의 타입을 정의하고 객체 리터럴에 타입 표명(type assertion)을 추가 할 수도 있습니다.\ninterface Options { color: string; volume: number }\n\nlet options = {} as Options;\noptions.color = \"red\";\noptions.volume = 11;\n\n또는 options에 any 타입이라고 하는 것이 가장 쉬운 방법이지만 가장 이득이 적은 일이 될 것입니다.\nany와 Object 그리고 {} (any, Object, and {})\n대부분의 경우 Object가 가장 일반적인 타입이기 때문에 Object 또는 {}를 사용하여 값에 프로퍼티를 포함할 수 있다고 말할 수 있습니다.하지만 any가 가장 유연한 타입이기 때문에 이러한 상황에서 실제로 사용하려는 타입입니다.\n예를 들어 Object 타입을 가지고 있다면 toLowerCase()와 같은 메서드를 호출할 수 없습니다.  \n좀 더 일반적이라는 것은 보통 타입을 사용하는 것이 적다는 것을 의미하지만 가장 일반적인 타입인 any는 여전히 어떤 것이든 할 수 있게 허용해준다는 점에서 특별합니다.즉 호출하여 구성하고 프로퍼티를 조작할 수 있습니다.하지만 any를 사용하면 TypeScript가 제공하는 대부분의 오류 검사 및 편집기 지원을 잃어 버리게 됩니다.\nObject와 {}로 판결났다면 {}을 선호해야 합니다.그것들은 대체로 같지만 비밀스러운 경우에는 기술적으로 {}가 Object보다 더 일반적인 타입입니다.\n엄격한 검사 받기 (Getting Stricter Checks)\nTypeScript는 프로그램의 안전성과 분석을 제공하기 위해 특정 검사를 제공합니다.일단 코드 베이스를 TypeScript로 변환한 후에는 이러한 검사를 활성화하여 안전성을 높일 수 있습니다.\n암시적인 any는 No (No Implicit any)\n타이프 스크립트가 어떤 타입이어야 할지 모르는 특정한 경우가 있습니다.가능하면 관대하기 위해 그 자리에 any 타입을 사용하기로 결정할 것입니다.이는 마이 그레이션에는 매우 유용하지만 any를 사용하면 어떠한 유형의 안전도 확보할 수 없으며 다른 곳에서 얻을 수 있는 것과 도구의 지원을 받을 수 없습니다.TypeScript에서 이러한 위치를 기록하도록 지시하고 noImplicitAny 옵션으로 오류를 표시할 수 있습니다.\n엄격한 null과 undefined 체크 (Strict null & undefined Checks)\n기본적으로 TypeScript는 null과 undefined이 모든 타입의 범위에 있다고 가정합니다.즉 number 타입으로 선언된 모든 것이 null 또는 undefined 일 수 있음을 의미합니다.  \nnull과 undefined는 JavaScript와 TypeScript에서 자주 발생하는 버그의 원천이기 때문에 TypeScript는 이에 대한 걱정을 덜어주기 위해 strictNullChecks 옵션을 가지고 있습니다.  \nstrictNullChecks가 활성화되면 null과 undefined는 null과 undefined 각각의 타입을 갖습니다.\n혹시 null 일 수 있는 항목이 있을 때 원래 타입을 union 타입으로 사용할 수 있습니다.그렇기 때문에 타입이 number(이)거나 null 일 수 있는 경우 해당 타입을 number | null로 쓰면 됩니다.\nTypeScript가 null /undefined라고 생각하는 값을 가지고 있지만 더 잘 알고 있다면 후위 연산자 !를 사용하여 다르게 사용할 수 있습니다.\ndeclare var foo: string[] | null;\n\nfoo.length;  // 오류 - 'foo'는 'null'일 수 있습니다.\n\nfoo!.length; // 좋아요 - 'foo!'에 'string[]'타입이 있습니다.\n\n참고로 strictNullChecks를 사용할 때는 strictNullChecks도 사용하기 위해 의존성을 업데이트해야 할 수도 있습니다.\n묵시적인 this의 any No!

(그러나 컴파일러는 체크하지 않습니다.)\n\nlet prettySure: Object = 4;\nprettySure.toFixed(); // 오류: 'Object' 타입에 'toFixed' 프로퍼티는 존재하지 않습니다.\n\nany 타입은 일부를 알고 있는 경우에도 유용하지만 모두 그렇지는 않습니다.예를 들어 배열이 있지만 배열에는 다른 타입이 혼재되어 있습니다:\nlet list: any[] = [1, true, \"free\"];\n\nlist[1] = 100;\n\nVoid\nvoid는 any 정반대이지만 조금 비슷합니다: 어떠한 타입의 부재도 전혀 없습니다.일반적으로 반환 값을 반환하지 않는 함수의 반환 타입으로 볼 수 있습니다:\nfunction warnUser(): void {\n    alert(\"This is my warning message\");\n}\n\nvoid 타입의 변수 선언은 undefined 또는 null 만 할당할 수 있으므로 유용하지 않습니다:\nlet unusable: void = undefined;\n\nNull 과 Undefined\nTypeScript에서 undefined와 null은 실제로 각기 undefined와 null이라는 자체적인 타입을 가집니다. void와 마찬가지로 그것들은 매우(극단적으로) 유용하지 않습니다 :\n// 그 외에도 이러한 변수에 할당할 수 있습니다!\nlet u: undefined = undefined;\nlet n: null = null;\n\n기본적으로 null과 undefined는 다른 모든 타입의 서브 타입입니다.즉 null과 undefined를 number와 같은 것으로 할당 할 수 있습니다.\n그러나 --strictNullChecks 플래그를 사용할 때 null과 undefined는 void와 그 각각의 타입에만 할당할 수 있습니다.이렇게 하면 많은 일반적인 오류를 피할 수 있습니다.string 또는 null 또는 undefined 중 하나를 전달하고자 하는 경우 string | null | undefined (union 타입)을 사용할 수 있습니다.다시 한 번 말하자면 이후에 더 많은 Union 타입에 관한 내용이 있습니다.\n\n메모: 가능한 한 --strictNullChecks 검사를 사용하도록 권장하지만 본 핸드북의 목적상 이 기능이 꺼져 있다고 가정하겠습니다.\n\nNever\nnever 타입은 절대로 발생하지 않는 값의 타입을 나타냅니다.예를 들어 never는 함수 표현식의 반환 타입이거나 항상 예외를 던지는 화살표 함수 표현식이거나 절대 반환하지 않는 표현식입니다.변수는 또한 never 일 때 타입 가드에 의해 좁혀지더라도 결코 사실일 수 없으며 타입을 획득하지 못합니다.\nnever 타입은 모든 타입의 서브 타입이며 모든 타입에 할당할 수 있습니다.어떤 타입도 never의 서브 타입이거나 할당 가능한 타입은 아닙니다 (never 자체를 제외하고).any 조차도 never에 할당할 수 없습니다.\nnever를 반환하는 함수의 몇 가지 예는 다음과 같습니다 :\n// 반환되는 함수에는 연결할 수 없는 end-point가 있어서는 안 됩니다.\nfunction error(message: string): never {\n    throw new Error(message);\n}\n\n// 추론되는 반환 타입은 절대로 없습니다.\nfunction fail() {\n    return error(\"Something failed\");\n}\n\n// 반환되는 함수에는 연결할 수 없는 end-point가 있어서는 안 됩니다.\nfunction infiniteLoop(): never {\n    while (true) {\n    }\n}\n\n타입 표명 (Type assertions)\n때로는 TypeScript보다 더 많은 값을 알아야 하는 상황에 놓일 수도 있습니다.일반적으로 이 문제는 일부 엔티티의 타입이 현재 타입보다 더 구체적일 수 있다는 것을 알고 있을 때 발생합니다.\nType assertions 은 컴파일러에게 \"나를 믿어, 내가 하고 있는 일을 안다\"라고 말하는 방법입니다.type assertion은 다른 언어의 형 변환(타입캐스팅)과 비슷하지만 특별한 검사나 데이터를 재구성하지는 않습니다.런타임에 영향을 미치지 않으며 컴파일러에서만 사용됩니다.TypeScript는 개발자가 필요한 특별한 검사를 수행했다고 가정합니다.\nType assertions은 두 가지 형태를 가집니다.하나는 \"angle-bracket\" (꺾쇠괄호) 구문입니다:\nlet someValue: any = \"this is a string\";\n\nlet strLength: number = (someValue).length;\n\n그리고 다른 하나는 구문은 as 입니다 :\nlet someValue: any = \"this is a string\";\n\nlet strLength: number = (someValue as string).length;\n\n두 샘플은 동일합니다.다른 하나를 사용하는 것은 주로 선호도에 따른 선택입니다. 그러나 TypeScript를 JSX와 함께 사용할 때는 as 스타일의 어설션만 허용됩니다.\nlet에 대한 메모\n지금까지 우리가 알고 있는 JavaScript의 var 키워드 대신 let 키워드를 사용했음을 알 수 있습니다.\nlet 키워드는 실제로 TypeScript에서 사용할 수 있는 더욱 새로운 JavaScript 구문입니다.나중에 더 자세히 논의하겠지만 JavaScript가 가지고 있는 많은 흔한 문제들은 let의 사용으로 해결할 수 있기 때문에 가능할 때마다 var 대신 let을 사용하는 것이 좋습니다.\n"},"pages/Variable Declarations.html":{"url":"pages/Variable Declarations.html","title":"변수 선언","keywords":"","body":"소개 (Introduction)\nlet과 const는 JavaScript에서 상대적으로 새로운 두 가지 유형의 변수 선언입니다.이전에 언급했듯이 let은 var와 유사하지만 사용자가 JavaScript로 실행하는 일반적인 \"결함\"을 피할 수 있습니다.const는 변수에 재 할당 할 수 없다는 점에서 let의 기능 확장입니다.\nTypeScript가 JavaScript의 상위 집합이기 때문에 자연스럽게 let과 const를 지원합니다.여기서 우리는 이 새로운 선언들에 대해 더 자세히 설명할 것이고 왜 그것들이 var보다 더 바람직한지를 자세히 설명 할 것입니다.\n만약 JavaScript를 아무렇게나 사용했다면 다음 섹션은 기억을 새롭게 하는 좋은 방법이 될 것입니다.JavaScript에서 var 선언의 모든 단점을 잘 알고 있다면 더 쉽게 건너뛸 수 있습니다.\nvar 선언 (var declarations)\n전통적으로 JavaScript에서 변수 선언은 var 키워드를 사용하였습니다.\nvar a = 10;\n\n알다시피 방금 a 변수의 값을 10 으로 선언하였습니다.\n또한 함수 내에서 변수를 선언할 수도 있습니다.\nfunction f() {\n    var message = \"Hello, world!\";\n\n    return message;\n}\n\n그리고 다른 함수 내부의 동일한 변수에 접근이 가능합니다.\nfunction f() {\n    var a = 10;\n    return function g() {\n        var b = a + 1;\n        return b;\n    }\n}\n\nvar g = f();\ng();

// 'a'를 선언하기전에 사용하는것은 불법입니다;\nlet a;\n\n주의해야 할 점은 블록-스코프 변수가 선언되기 전에 변수를 캡쳐할 수 있다는 것입니다.선언전에 해당 함수을 실행시키는 것은 불법이라는 것을 알 수 있습니다.\nES2015를 목표로 한다면 현대적인 런타임은 오류를 던질 것입니다; 그러나 지금은 TypeScripts는 허용되며 오류로 보고하지 않습니다.\nfunction foo() {\n    // 'a'를 캡쳐합니다\n    return a;\n}\n\n// 잘못된 호출로 'foo'가 선언되기 전에 'a'가 선언됩니다.\n// 여기서 런타임 오류가 발생해야합니다.\nfoo();\n\nlet a;\n\nTemporal dead zone 에 대한 자세한 내용은 Mozilla 개발자 네트워크 의 관련 내용을 참조하십시오.\n재선언과 Shadowing (Re-declarations and Shadowing)\nvar 를 선언한 횟수가 중요하지 않다고 언급했습니다. 단지 변수를 하나 얻었을 뿐입니다.\nfunction f(x) {\n    var x;\n    var x;\n\n    if (true) {\n        var x;\n    }\n}\n\n위의 예에서 x의 모든 선언은 실제로 동일한 x를 참조하며 이는 완전히 유효합니다.이것은 종종 버그의 원인이 됩니다. 고맙게도 let 에서는 이런 것을 허용하지 않습니다.\nlet x = 10;\nlet x = 20; // 오류: 동일한 스코프에서 'x'를 다시 선언 할 수 없습니다.\n\nTypeScript의 블록-스코프는 두개의 같은 변수는 필요하지 않다고 우리에게 문제를 말해줍니다.\nfunction f(x) {\n    let x = 100; // 오류: 매개변수가 변수 선언에 간섭하고 있습니다.\n}\n\nfunction g() {\n    let x = 100;\n    var x = 100; // 오류: 'x'의 선언을 두 번 할 수 없습니다.\n}\n\n블록-스코프 변수가 함수-스코프 변수로 선언될 수 없다는 뜻은 아닙니다.블록-스코프 변수는 명확하게 다른 블록 내에서 선언되어야합니다.\nfunction f(condition, x) {\n    if (condition) {\n        let x = 100;\n        return x;\n    }\n\n    return x;\n}\n\nf(false, 0); // '0' 반환\nf(true, 0);  // '100' 반환\n\n중첩된 스코프에서 기존의 변수 이름을 사용하는 것을 shadowing 이라고 합니다. shadowing 은 우발적인 버그를 유발하는 동시에 버그를 예방할 수도 있다는 점에서 양날의 검입니다.\n예를 들어 let 변수를 사용하여 이전 sumMatrix 함수를 작성했다고 가정해 보겠습니다.\nfunction sumMatrix(matrix: number[][]) {\n    let sum = 0;\n    for (let i = 0; i \n이번 버전의 루프는 내부의 반복문의 i가 외부의 반복문의 i를 shadows하기때문에 실제로 합계를 합니다.\nShadowing은 보통 더 명확한 코드를 작성하기 위해 피해야 합니다. 이를 활용할 수 있는 몇 가지 시나리오가 있을 수 있지만 최선의 판단을 내려야 합니다.\n블럭-스코프 변수 캡쳐\nvar 선언으로 변수 캡쳐를 처음 접했을 때 우리는 일단 캡쳐된 변수가 어떻게 작동하는지 간략하게 살펴보았습니다.이것에 대한 직감적이고 더 나은 직감을 주기 위해 스코프가 실행될 때마다 변수의 \"환경\"을 생성합니다.해당 환경 및 캡쳐 된 변수는 스코프 내의 모든 항목이 완료된 후에도 존재할 수 있습니다\nfunction theCityThatAlwaysSleeps() {\n    let getCity;\n\n    if (true) {\n        let city = \"Seattle\";\n        getCity = function() {\n            return city;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return getCity();\n}\n\n환경내에서 city를 캡쳐했으므로 if 블록이 실행을 완료 했음에도 불구하고 여전히 접근할 수 있습니다.\n이전의 setTimeout 예제에서 for 문을 반복할 때마다 변수의 상태를 캡쳐하기 위해 IIFE를 사용해야한다는 결론을 얻었습니다.실제로 하고 있던 것은 캡쳐한 변수를 위한 새로운 변수 환경을 만드는 것이었습니다.그것은 약간의 고통이었지만 다행스럽게도 TypeScript에서 그렇게 할 필요가 없습니다.\nlet은 루프의 일부로 선언될 때 크게 다른 동작을 합니다.루프 자체에 새로운 환경을 도입하기보다는 이러한 선언은 반복마다 새로운 스코프를 만듭니다.이것이 IIFE로 하고 있었던 것을 let 을 사용하여 이전의 setTimeout 예제를 바꿀 수 있습니다.\nfor (let i = 0; i \n예상한대로 출력됩니다.\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\nconst 선언 (const declarations)\nconst 는 변수를 선언하는 또 다른 방법입니다.\nconst numLivesForCat = 9;\n\n그것은 let 선언과 같지만 그 이름에서 알 수 있듯이 바인딩 된 후에는 값을 변경할 수 없습니다.즉 let과 동일한 스코프 규칙을 가지고 있지만 규칙을 다시 할당할 수 없습니다.\n이것은 참조하는 값이 불변 이라는 개념과 혼동되어서는 안됩니다.\nconst numLivesForCat = 9;\nconst kitty = {\n    name: \"Aurora\",\n    numLives: numLivesForCat,\n}\n\n// 오류\nkitty = {\n    name: \"Danielle\",\n    numLives: numLivesForCat\n};\n\n// 모두 \"오케이\"\nkitty.name = \"Rory\";\nkitty.name = \"Kitty\";\nkitty.name = \"Cat\";\nkitty.numLives--;\n\n이를 방지하기 위해 구체적인 조치를 취하지 않는 한 const변수의 내부 상태는 여전히 수정할 수 있습니다. 다행히 TypeScript를 사용하면 객체의 멤버를 readonly로 지정할 수 있습니다.\nInterfaces 챕터에서 자세한 내용을 다룹니다.\nlet vs. const\n비슷한 스코프 지정 의미론을 가진 두 가지 선언이 있다고 가정할 때 어떤 것을 사용할 것인지를 묻는 것은 당연합니다.\n대부분의 질문들과 같이 그 대답도 다음과 같습니다: 그것은 다릅니다.\nprinciple of least privilege (최소 권한 원칙) 적용하면 수정할 권한을 제외한 모든 선언은 'const'를 사용해야 합니다.\n근본적인 이유는 변수를 쓸 필요가 없는 경우 동일한 코드 베이스에서 작업하는 다른 사용자가 자동으로 객체에 쓸 수 없으므로 변수에 재할당 할 필요가 있는지 여부를 고려해야 합니다.\n또한 const를 사용하면 데이터 흐름을 추론할 때 코드를 더 예측 가능하게 만들 수 있습니다.\n최선을 판단을 하여 해당되는 경우 팀원들과 이 문제를 상의하십시오.\n이 handbook 의 경우 대부분 let 선언을 사용합니다.\n비구조화 (Destructuring)\nTypeScript에 있는 또 다른 ECMAScript2015 기능은 비구조화입니다.전체 참조 정보는 Mozilla Developer Network의 기사를 참조하십시오. 이 섹션에서는 간단한 개요를 제공합니다.\n배열 비구조화 (Array destructuring)\n가장 간단한 구조 해체 방법은 배열 비구조화 할당입니다.\nlet input = [1, 2];\nlet [first, second] = input;\nconsole.log(first); // 1 출력\nconsole.log(second); // 2 출력\n\n이것은 first와 second라는 두 개의 새로운 변수를 만듭니다.\n이는 인덱스를 사용하는 것과 동일하지만 훨씬 편리합니다.\nfirst = input[0];\nsecond = input[1];\n\n비구조화는 이미 선언된 변수에서도 작동합니다.\n// 변수 교환\n[first, second] = [second, first];\n\n함수에 대한 매개 변수가 있는 경우\nfunction f([first, second]: [number, number]) {\n    console.log(first);\n    console.log(second);\n}\nf([1, 2]);\n\n... 구문을 사용하여 목록의 나머지 항목에 대한 변수를 생성할 수 있습니다.\nlet [first, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4];\nconsole.log(first); // 1 출력\nconsole.log(rest); // [ 2, 3, 4 ] 출력\n\n물론 이것은 JavaScript이므로 관심이 없는 후행 요소는 무시할 수 있습니다.\nlet [first] = [1, 2, 3, 4];\nconsole.log(first); // 1 출력\n\n또는 다른 요소들 :\nlet [, second, , fourth] = [1, 2, 3, 4];\n\n객체 비구조화 (Object destructuring)\n또한 객체를 해체할 수 있습니다.\nlet o = {\n    a: \"foo\",\n    b: 12,\n    c: \"bar\"\n};\nlet { a, b } = o;\n\n이것은 o.a와 o.b에서 새로운 변수 a와 b를 생성합니다. 필요없는 경우 c를 건너뛸 수 있습니다.\n배열 비구조화처럼 선언없이 할당 수 있습니다.\n({ a, b } = { a: \"baz\", b: 101 });\n\n이 문장을 괄호로 묶어야한다는 것을 주목하십시오. JavaScript는 일반적으로 a{를 블록 시작으로 파싱합니다.\n... 구문을 사용하여 객체의 나머지 항목에 대한 변수를 만들 수 있습니다\nlet { a, ...passthrough } = o;\nlet total = passthrough.b + passthrough.c.length;\n\n프로퍼티 이름 변경 (Property renaming)\n프로퍼티의 이름 또한 다름 이름으로 지정할 수 있습니다.\nlet { a: newName1, b: newName2 } = o;\n\n문장이 혼란스러워지기 시작했습니다.\na : newName1를 \"a as newName1\"로 읽을 수 있습니다.\n방향은 왼쪽에서 오른쪽으로 사용합니다.\nlet newName1 = o.a;\nlet newName2 = o.b;\n\n혼란스럽겠지만 여기서 콜론은 타입을 나타내는 콜론은 아닙니다.형식을 지정하는 경우 전체 형식이 비구조화된 후에도 형식을 작성해야 합니다.\nlet { a, b }: { a: string, b: number } = o;\n\n기본값 (Default values)\n기본값을 사용하면 프로퍼티가 정의되지 않은 경우의 기본값을 지정할 수 있습니다.\nfunction keepWholeObject(wholeObject: { a: string, b?: number }) {\n    let { a, b = 1001 } = wholeObject;\n}\n\nkeepWholeObject 함수는 b가 정의되지 않더라도 a와 b 프로퍼티뿐만 아니라 wholeObject의 변수를 가집니다.\n함수 선언 (Function declarations)\n비구조화는 함수 선언에서도 작동합니다. 간단한 예를 보겠습니다.\ntype C = { a: string, b?: number }\nfunction f({ a, b }: C): void {\n    // ...\n}\n\n그러나 매개 변수에 대해 기본값을 지정하는 것이 더 일반적이며 비구조화시 기본값을 가져오는 것은 까다로울 수 있습니다.\n우선 기본값 앞에 패턴을 두는 것을 기억해야 합니다.\nfunction f({ a, b } = { a: \"\", b: 0 }): void {\n    // ...\n}\nf(); // 오케이, 기본값 { a: \"\", b: 0 }\n\n\n위의 코드는 나중에 handbook에서 설명할 유형 추론의 한 예제입니다.\n\n그런 다음 기본 초기화가 아닌 비구조화 프로퍼티에 대한 선택적인 프로퍼티를 기본값으로 지정한다는 것을 기억해야 합니다.c에서 b는 선택사항으로 지정되었다는 것을 기억하세요.\nfunction f({ a, b = 0 } = { a: \"\" }): void {\n    // ...\n}\nf({ a: \"yes\" }); // 오케이, 기본값 b = 0\nf(); // 오케이, 기본값은 { a:\"\" }이며 이 경우 기본값은 b = 0입니다.\nf({}); // 오류, 인수를 제공하려면 'a'가 필요합니다.\n\n비구조화를 조심히 사용하세요. 앞의 예제에서 보여 주듯이 가장 단순한 비구조화 표현식을 제외하고는 혼란스럽습니다.이름 바꾸기 기본값 및 타입을 주석으로 써놓지 않고는 이해하기 힘든 깊은 형태를 비구조화하는 것은 특히 그렇습니다.\n비구조화 표현식은 작고 심플하게 유지하세요.\n직접 생성한 비구조화를 항상 스스로 쓸 수 있어야 합니다.\n전개 연산자 (Spread)\n전개는 비구조화의 반대입니다. 배열을 다른 배열로 객체를 다른 객체로 전개하는 것을 허용합니다.\n예를 들어:\nlet first = [1, 2];\nlet second = [3, 4];\nlet bothPlus = [0, ...first, ...second, 5];\n\n이것은 bothPlus에 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]값을 부여합니다. 전개는 first와 second의 얕은 복사본을 만듭니다. 그들은 전개에 의해 변하지 않습니다.\n또한 객체를 전개 할 수도 있습니다.\nlet defaults = { food: \"spicy\", price: \"$$\", ambiance: \"noisy\" };\nlet search = { ...defaults, food: \"rich\" };\n\n현재 search의 값은 { food: \"rich\", price: \"$$\", ambiance: \"noisy\" }입니다.객체의 전개는 배열의 전개보다 복잡합니다. 배열은 전개를 왼쪽에서 오른쪽으로 진행하지만 결과는 여전히 객체입니다.이것은 나중에 전개한 객체의 프로퍼티가 이전에 있던 프로퍼티를 덮어씁니다.따라서 끝에 전개할 이전의 코드를 수정하면 다음과 같습니다.\nlet defaults = { food: \"spicy\", price: \"$$\", ambiance: \"noisy\" };\nlet search = { food: \"rich\", ...defaults };\n\ndefaults의 food속성을 food: \"rich\"로 덮어쓰는데 우리는 이것을 원한 게 아닙니다.\n객체 Spread에는 몇 가지 다른 놀라운 한계가 있습니다.\n첫번째, 열거 가능 속성(own, enumerable properties) 객체에 포함됩니다. 기본적으로 당신이 객체의 인스턴스를 전개할 때 메소드를 잃어버린다는 것을 의미합니다.\nclass C {\n  p = 12;\n  m() {\n  }\n}\nlet c = new C();\nlet clone = { ...c };\nclone.p; // 오케이\nclone.m(); // 오류!\n\n두번째, Typescript 컴파일러는 일반 함수의 매개변수를 전개로 허용하지 않습니다.이 기능은 향후 버전의 언어에서 사용될 것으로 예상됩니다.\n"},"pages/Interfaces.html":{"url":"pages/Interfaces.html","title":"인터페이스","keywords":"","body":"소개 (Introduction)\nTypeScript의 핵심 원리 중 하나는 값이 가지는 형태에 초점을 맞추는 타입-체킹을 한다는 것입니다.이것은 때때로 \"덕 타이핑(duck typing)\" 또는 \"구조적 하위 유형화(structural subtyping)\"라고도 합니다.TypeScript에서는 인터페이스가 이러한 타입의 이름을 지정하는 역할을 하며 코드 내에서 계약을 정의하고 프로젝트 외부에서 코드를 사용하는 계약을 정의하는 강력한 방법입니다.\n첫번째 인터페이스 (Our First Interface)\n인터페이스의 작동 방식을 확인하는 가장 쉬운 방법은 간단한 예를 들어 시작하는 것입니다:\nfunction printLabel(labelledObj: { label: string }) {\n    console.log(labelledObj.label);\n}\n\nlet myObj = {size: 10, label: \"Size 10 Object\"};\nprintLabel(myObj);\n\n타입-체커는 printLabel에 대한 호출을 확인합니다.PrintLabel 함수에는 객체를 전달하는 데 필요한 단일 매개변수가 있으며 이는 문자열 타입의 label 프로퍼티를 가집니다.실제로 객체는 이보다 더 많은 프로퍼티를 가지고 있지만 컴파일러는 필요한 속성이 최소한 있고 필요한 타입과 일치하는지만 검사합니다.TypeScript가 그렇게 관대하지 않은 경우도 있습니다. 이에 대해 좀 더 자세히 다룰 것입니다.\n이번에도 인터페이스를 사용하여 문자열 타입인 label 프로퍼티를 가져야 한다는 요구 사항을 설명하는 동일한 예제를 다시 작성할 수 있습니다:\ninterface LabelledValue {\n    label: string;\n}\n\nfunction printLabel(labelledObj: LabelledValue) {\n    console.log(labelledObj.label);\n}\n\nlet myObj = {size: 10, label: \"Size 10 Object\"};\nprintLabel(myObj);\n\n인터페이스 LabelledValue은 이전 예제의 요구 사항을 설명하는 데 사용할 수 있는 이름입니다.여전히 label이라는 문자열 타입의 단일 프로퍼티가 있습니다.printLabel에 전달하는 객체가 다른 언어처럼 이 인터페이스를 구현한다고 명시적으로 말할 필요가 없었습니다.여기서는 중요한 형태일 뿐입니다. 함수로 전달되는 객체가 나열된 요구 사항을 충족하는 경우 허용됩니다.\n타입-체커에서는 이러한 프로퍼티가 순서대로 제공될 것을 요구하지 않으며 다만 인터페이스에 필요한 속성이 있고 필요한 타입만 필요하다는 점을 지적하는 것이 중요합니다.\n선택적 프로퍼티 (Optional Properties)\n인터페이스의 모든 프로퍼티가 필수로 필요할 수는 없습니다.어떤 것들은 특정한 조건 하에 존재하거나 아예 존재하지 않을 수도 있습니다.이러한 선택적 프로퍼티는 프로퍼티 중에서 일부만 채워진 객체를 함수에 전달하는 \"옵션 가방(option bags)\"과 같은 패턴을 생성할 때 많이 사용됩니다.\n다음은 이 패턴의 예입니다:\ninterface SquareConfig {\n    color?: string;\n    width?: number;\n}\n\nfunction createSquare(config: SquareConfig): {color: string; area: number} {\n    let newSquare = {color: \"white\", area: 100};\n    if (config.color) {\n        newSquare.color = config.color;\n    }\n    if (config.width) {\n        newSquare.area = config.width * config.width;\n    }\n    return newSquare;\n}\n\nlet mySquare = createSquare({color: \"black\"});\n\n선택적 프로퍼티를 가진 인터페이스는 다른 인터페이스와 유사하게 작성되며 선언된 프로퍼티 이름 끝에 ?로 표시됩니다.\n선택적 프로퍼티의 장점은 사용 가능한 프로퍼티를 설명하는 동시에 인터페이스에 포함되지 않은 프로퍼티의 사용을 방지할 수 있다는 것입니다.\n예를 들어 createSquare에서 color 프로퍼티의 이름을 잘못 입력하면 다음과 같은 오류 메시지가 표시됩니다:\ninterface SquareConfig {\n    color?: string;\n    width?: number;\n}\n\nfunction createSquare(config: SquareConfig): { color: string; area: number } {\n    let newSquare = {color: \"white\", area: 100};\n    if (config.color) {\n        // 오류 : 'SquareConfig' 타입에 'clor'프로퍼티가 존재하지 않습니다. \n        newSquare.color = config.clor;\n    }\n    if (config.width) {\n        newSquare.area = config.width * config.width;\n    }\n    return newSquare;\n}\n\nlet mySquare = createSquare({color: \"black\"});\n\n읽기 전용 프로퍼티 (Readonly properties)\n일부 프로퍼티는 객체를 처음 생성할 때만 수정할 수 있어야 합니다. 프로퍼티 이름 앞에 readonly을 붙여 넣어 지정할 수 있습니다:\ninterface Point {\n    readonly x: number;\n    readonly y: number;\n}\n\n객체 리터럴을 할당하여 Point를 구성 할 수 있습니다. 할당 후 x와 y는 바꿀 수 없습니다.\nlet p1: Point = { x: 10, y: 20 };\np1.x = 5; // 오류!\n\nTypeScript에는 모든 변형 메서드가 제거된 Array와 동일한 ReadonlyArray타입이 있으므로 생성 후 배열을 변경하지 말아야 합니다.\nlet a: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4];\nlet ro: ReadonlyArray = a;\nro[0] = 12; // 오류!\nro.push(5); // 오류!\nro.length = 100; // 오류!\na = ro; // 오류!\n\n코드의 마지막 줄에서 전체 ReadonlyArray를 일반적인 배열로 다시 할당하는 것조차도 불법임을 알 수 있습니다.그럼에도 불구하고 타입 표명(assertion)을 통해 오버라이드 할 수 있습니다.\na = ro as number[];\n\nreadonly vs const\nreadonly을 사용할지 아니면 const 사용할지 기억할 수 있는 가장 쉬운 방법은 변수에서 사용할지 또는 프로퍼티에서 사용할지를 묻는 것입니다.변수는 const를 사용하는 반면 프로퍼티는 readonly를 사용합니다.\n프로퍼티 초과 검사 (Excess Property Checks)\n인터페이스를 사용하는 첫 번째 예에서 TypeScript를 사용하면 { size: number; label: string; }을 { label: string; }으로만 예상하는 항목으로 전달할 수 있습니다.또한 선택적 프로퍼티에 대해서 배웠고 그것이 소위 말하는 \"옵션 가방(option bags)\"을 설명할 때 어떻게 유용한지도 배웠습니다.\n그러나 두 가지를 결합하는 것은 JavaScript에서와 하고 있는 것과 같은 방식으로 자신의 무덤을 파는 것입니다.예를 들어 createSquare를 사용한 마지막 예제를 봅시다:\ninterface SquareConfig {\n    color?: string;\n    width?: number;\n}\n\nfunction createSquare(config: SquareConfig): { color: string; area: number } {\n    // ...\n}\n\nlet mySquare = createSquare({ colour: \"red\", width: 100 });\n\ncreateSquare의 인수는 color가 아닌 colour 입니다. 보통의 JavaScript에서는 이러한 종류의 작업은 조용히 실패합니다.\nwidth 프로퍼티가 호환되고 color 프로퍼티가 없으며 특별하게 color 프로퍼티가 대수롭지 않기 때문에 이 프로그램이 올바른 타입임을 주장할 수 있습니다.\n그러나 TypeScript는 이 코드에 버그가 있을 수 있음을 나타냅니다.객체 리터럴은 다른 변수에 할당하거나 인수로 전달할 때 특별한 처리를 받아 프로퍼티 초과 검사(Excess Property Checks) 를 거칩니다.객체 리터럴에 \"대상 타입\"에 없는 속성이 있으면 오류가 발생합니다.\n// 오류 : 'colour'는 'SquareConfig' 타입에서 필요하지 않습니다.\nlet mySquare = createSquare({ colour: \"red\", width: 100 });\n\n이런 점검을 하는 것은 실제로 정말 간단합니다.가장 쉬운 방법은 타입 표명(type assertion)을 사용하는 것입니다:\nlet mySquare = createSquare({ width: 100, opacity: 0.5 } as SquareConfig);\n\n하지만 객체에 특별한 방법으로 사용되는 추가 프로퍼티가 있는 것이 확실한 경우 문자열 인덱스 서명(string index signature)을 추가하는 것이 더 좋습니다.\nSquareConfig가 위의 타입이 포함되는 color 및 width 프로퍼티가 가질 수 있지만 또 다른 속성도 있는 경우에는 다음과 같이 정의할 수 있습니다.\ninterface SquareConfig {\n    color?: string;\n    width?: number;\n    [propName: string]: any;\n}\n\n이후에 인덱스 서명(index signatures)에 대해 이야기하겠지만 SquareConfig은 여러 프로퍼티들을 가질 수 있으며 color 이나 width가 아닌 다른 프로퍼티들의 타입은 문제 되지 않습니다.\n이러한 검사를 하는 마지막 방법 중 하나는 객체를 다른 변수에 할당하는 것입니다: squareOptions은 너무 프로퍼티 초과 검사를 거치지 않기 때문에 컴파일러가 오류를 제공하지 않습니다:\nlet squareOptions = { colour: \"red\", width: 100 };\nlet mySquare = createSquare(squareOptions);\n\n위와 같은 간단한 코드의 경우에는 이러한 검사를 \"회피하는\" 시도를 하지 말아야 합니다.메서드와 상태를 유지하는 더 복잡한 객체 리터럴의 경우 이러한 기법을 유지하고 싶은 마음이겠지만 대부분의 초과 프로퍼티 오류는 실제로 버그입니다.즉 옵션 가방(option bags)과 같은 물건에 대해 초과 프로퍼티 검사 문제가 발생하는 경우 타입 선언 중 일부를 수정해야 할 수도 있습니다.이 경우 createSquare에 color or colour 프로퍼티를 모두 포함한 객체를 전달하는 것이 괜찮은 경우 squareConfig의 정의를 수정해야 합니다.\n함수 타입 (Function Types)\n인터페이스는 JavaScript 객체가 취할 수 있는 다양한 형태을 형성할 수 있습니다.프로퍼티를 가진 객체를 설명하는 것 외에도 인터페이스는 함수 타입을 형성할 수도 있습니다.\n인터페이스가 포함된 함수의 타입을 형성하기 위해 인터페이스에 호출 서명(call signature)을 제공합니다.이것은 매개 변수 목록과 반환 타입만 주어진 함수 선언과 같습니다. 매개 변수 목록의 각 매개 변수에는 이름과 타입이 모두 필요합니다.\ninterface SearchFunc {\n    (source: string, subString: string): boolean;\n}\n\n일단 정의되면 다른 인터페이스처럼 이 함수 타입의 인터페이스를 사용할 수 있습니다.여기서는 함수 타입의 변수를 생성하고 동일한 타입의 함수 값을 할당하는 방법을 보여줍니다.\nlet mySearch: SearchFunc;\nmySearch = function(source: string, subString: string) {\n    let result = source.search(subString);\n    return result > -1;\n}\n\n함수 타입의 타입을 점검할 때 매개 변수의 이름이 일치할 필요는 없습니다. 예를 들어 다음과 같은 예를 작성할 수 있습니다:\nlet mySearch: SearchFunc;\nmySearch = function(src: string, sub: string): boolean {\n    let result = src.search(sub);\n    return result > -1;\n}\n\n함수 매개 변수는 하나씩 점검되며 각 해당 파라미터 위치의 타입을 서로 비교하며 점검합니다.타입을 지정하지 않으려는 경우 함수 값이 SearchFunc 타입의 변수에 직접 지정되므로 TypeScript의 컨텍스트 타입(contextual typing)에 따라 인수 타입을 추론할 수 있습니다.또한 여기서 함수 표현식의 반환 타입은 반환되는 값에 의해서도 암시적으로 나타납니다(여기서는 false와 true)함수 표현식이 숫자나 문자열을 반환하는 경우 타입-체커가 반환 타입이 SearchFunc 인터페이스에 설명된 반환 타입과 일치하지 않는다는 경고했을 것입니다\nlet mySearch: SearchFunc;\nmySearch = function(src, sub) {\n    let result = src.search(sub);\n    return result > -1;\n}\n\n인덱싱 가능 타입(Indexable Types)\n함수 타입을 설명하기 위해 인터페이스를 사용하는 방법과 마찬가지로 a[10] 또는 ageMap[\"daniel\"]처럼 \"인덱스를\" 생성할 수 있는 타입을 만들 수도 있습니다.인덱싱 가능 타입에는 객체로 인덱싱 하는 데 사용할 수 있는 타입과 인덱싱 할 때 해당 반환 타입을 설명하는 인덱스 서명(index signature) 이 있습니다.예를 들어 보겠습니다.\ninterface StringArray {\n    [index: number]: string;\n}\n\nlet myArray: StringArray;\nmyArray = [\"Bob\", \"Fred\"];\n\nlet myStr: string = myArray[0];\n\n위에서 우리는 인덱스 서명(index signature)을 가진 String Array 인터페이스를 가지고 있습니다.이 인덱스 서명은 StringArray이 number로 인덱싱 될 때 string을 반환한다는 것을 나타냅니다.\n지원되는 인덱스 서명에는 문자열과 숫자의 두 가지 타입이 있습니다.두 가지 타입의 인덱서(indexer)를 모두 지원할 수 있지만 숫자(numeric) 인덱서에서 반환되는 타입은 문자열(string) 인덱서에서 반환된 타입의 하위 타입이어야 합니다.왜냐하면 number로 인덱싱을 생성하는 시점에 JavaScript가 객체로 인덱싱하기 전에 string으로 변환하기 때문입니다.즉 100 (number)로 인덱싱하는 것은 \"100\" (string)으로 인덱싱하는 것과 동일하므로 두 가지 모두 일관성이 있어야 합니다.\nclass Animal {\n    name: string;\n}\nclass Dog extends Animal {\n    breed: string;\n}\n\n// 오류: numeric과 string으로 인덱싱하면 완전히 다른 타입의 Animal을 얻을 수 있습니다!\ninterface NotOkay {\n    [x: number]: Animal;\n    [x: string]: Dog;\n}\n\n문자열 인덱스 서명(index signatures)이 \"사전(dictionary)\" 패턴을 만드는 강력한 방법이지만 모든 프로퍼티가 반환 타입과 일치하도록 강요합니다.문자열 인덱스의 obj.property가 obj[\"property\"]으로도 사용할 수 있다고 선언하기 때문입니다.다음 예에서는 name의 타입이 문자열 인덱스의 타입과 일치하지 않으며 타입-체커에서 오류를 표시합니다\ninterface NumberDictionary {\n    [index: string]: number;\n    length: number;    // 좋아요, length는 number입니다.\n    name: string;      // 오류, 'name'의 타입이 인덱서의 하위 타입이 아닙니다.\n}\n\n마지막으로 인덱스에 할당되지 않도록 인덱스 서명(index signatures)을 읽기 전용(readonly)으로 만들 수 있습니다:\ninterface ReadonlyStringArray {\n    readonly [index: number]: string;\n}\nlet myArray: ReadonlyStringArray = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\"];\nmyArray[2] = \"Mallory\"; // 오류!\n\n인덱스 서명이 읽기 전용이므로 myArray[2]를 설정할 수 없습니다.\n클래스 타입 (Class Types)\n인터페이스 구현 (Implementing an interface)\nC# 및 Java와 같은 언어로 인터페이스를 사용하는 가장 일반적인 방법 중 하나로 클래스가 특정 계약을 충족하도록 명시적인 강제가 TypeScript에서도 가능하다는 것입니다.\ninterface ClockInterface {\n    currentTime: Date;\n}\n\nclass Clock implements ClockInterface {\n    currentTime: Date;\n    constructor(h: number, m: number) { }\n}\n\n또한 아래의 예제에서 setTime과 마찬가지로 클래스에 구현된 인터페이스의 메서드를 만들 수도 있습니다.\ninterface ClockInterface {\n    currentTime: Date;\n    setTime(d: Date);\n}\n\nclass Clock implements ClockInterface {\n    currentTime: Date;\n    setTime(d: Date) {\n        this.currentTime = d;\n    }\n    constructor(h: number, m: number) { }\n}\n\n인터페이스는 public 측면과 private 측면이 아닌 public 측면의 class를 만듭니다.클래스를 사용하여 클래스 인스턴스의 private 측에 특정 타입이 있는지 점검하는 것은 금지되어 있습니다.\n클래스의 스태틱과 인스턴스의 차이점(Difference between the static and instance sides of classes)\n클래스와 인터페이스로 작업할 때 클래스에 두 가지 타입이 있음을 명심하세요: 스태틱 측면의 타입과 인스턴스 측면의 타입construct signature으로 인터페이스를 만들고 이 인터페이스를 구현하는 클래스를 생성하려고 하면 오류가 발생할 수 있습니다:\ninterface ClockConstructor {\n    new (hour: number, minute: number);\n}\n\nclass Clock implements ClockConstructor {\n    currentTime: Date;\n    constructor(h: number, m: number) { }\n}\n\n왜냐하면 클래스가 인터페이스를 구현할 때 클래스의 인스턴스 측면만 검사되기 때문입니다.생성자는 정적인 측면이기 때문에 이 점검에 포함되지 않습니다.\n대신 클래스의 정적인 측면에서 직접 작업해야 합니다.이 예제에서는 생성자를 위한 ClockConstructor와 인스턴스 메서드를 위한 ClockInterface라는 두 개의 인터페이스를 정의합니다.편의상 전달된 타입의 인스턴스를 생성하는 createClock 생성자 함수를 정의합니다.\ninterface ClockConstructor {\n    new (hour: number, minute: number): ClockInterface;\n}\ninterface ClockInterface {\n    tick();\n}\n\nfunction createClock(ctor: ClockConstructor, hour: number, minute: number): ClockInterface {\n    return new ctor(hour, minute);\n}\n\nclass DigitalClock implements ClockInterface {\n    constructor(h: number, m: number) { }\n    tick() {\n        console.log(\"beep beep\");\n    }\n}\nclass AnalogClock implements ClockInterface {\n    constructor(h: number, m: number) { }\n    tick() {\n        console.log(\"tick tock\");\n    }\n}\n\nlet digital = createClock(DigitalClock, 12, 17);\nlet analog = createClock(AnalogClock, 7, 32);\n\ncreateClock의 첫 번째 매개 변수는 createClock(AnalogClock, 7, 32)에 ClockConstructor 타입이므로 AnalogClock이 올바른 생성자 서명(constructor signature)을 가지고 있는지 확인합니다.\n인터페이스 확장 (Extending Interfaces)\n클래스처럼 인터페이스도 서로를 확장할 수 있습니다.이렇게 하면 한 인터페이스의 멤버를 다른 인터페이스로 복사할 수 있으므로 인터페이스를 재사용 가능한 컴포넌트로 분리하는 방법을 더 유연하게 할 수 있습니다.\ninterface Shape {\n    color: string;\n}\n\ninterface Square extends Shape {\n    sideLength: number;\n}\n\nlet square = {};\nsquare.color = \"blue\";\nsquare.sideLength = 10;\n\n여러 인터페이스를 확장하여 모든 인터페이스를 결합하여 만들 수 있습니다.\ninterface Shape {\n    color: string;\n}\n\ninterface PenStroke {\n    penWidth: number;\n}\n\ninterface Square extends Shape, PenStroke {\n    sideLength: number;\n}\n\nlet square = {};\nsquare.color = \"blue\";\nsquare.sideLength = 10;\nsquare.penWidth = 5.0;\n\n하이브리드 타입 (Hybrid Types)\n이전에 언급했듯이 인터페이스는 실제 JavaScript에서 제공되는 풍부한 타입을 만들 수 있습니다.JavaScript의 동적이고 유연한 특성으로 인해 위에 설명된 몇 가지 타입의 조합으로 작동하는 객체를 종종 볼 수 있습니다.\n이러한 예로는 다음과 같이 추가 프로퍼티로 함수와 객체 역할을 모두 하는 객체가 있습니다:\ninterface Counter {\n    (start: number): string;\n    interval: number;\n    reset(): void;\n}\n\nfunction getCounter(): Counter {\n    let counter = function (start: number) { };\n    counter.interval = 123;\n    counter.reset = function () { };\n    return counter;\n}\n\nlet c = getCounter();\nc(10);\nc.reset();\nc.interval = 5.0;\n\n서드파티 JavaScript와 상호 작용할 때 타입의 형태를 완전히 형성하려면 위와 같은 패턴을 사용해야 할 수 있습니다.\n인터페이스 확장 클래스 (Interfaces Extending Classes)\n인터페이스 타입이 클래스 타입을 확장하면 해당 클래스의 멤버들을 상속하지만 구현을 상속하지는 않습니다.이는 마치 인터페이스가 구현을 제공하지 않고 클래스의 모든 멤버를 선언한 것과 같습니다.인터페이스는 기본 클래스의 private 및 protected 멤버조차도 상속합니다.즉 private 또는 protected 멤버가 있는 클래스를 확장하는 인터페이스를 생성하면 해당 인터페이스 타입은 해당 클래스 또는 해당 클래스의 서브 클래스에서만 구현할 수 있습니다.\n이는 상속 계층이 크지만 특정 프로퍼티를 가진 서브 클래스에서만 코드가 작동하도록 지정하려는 경우에 유용합니다.서브 클래스는 기본 클래스에서 상속받는 것 외에는 관련이 없습니다.\n예를 들어:\nclass Control {\n    private state: any;\n}\n\ninterface SelectableControl extends Control {\n    select(): void;\n}\n\nclass Button extends Control implements SelectableControl {\n    select() { }\n}\n\nclass TextBox extends Control {\n    select() { }\n}\n\n// 오류: 'Image' 타입의 'state' 프로퍼티가 없습니다.\nclass Image implements SelectableControl {\n    select() { }\n}\n\nclass Location {\n\n}\n\n위의 예제에서 SelectableControl에는 Private state 프로퍼티를 포함한 Control의 모든 멤버가 포함되어 있습니다.state는 private 멤버이기 때문에 Control의 자식만 SelectableControl을 구현할 수 있습니다.왜냐하면 Control의 자식들만이 같은 선언에서 시작된 state private 멤버를 가지기 때문입니다.이것은 private 멤버들이 호환 가능해야 합니다.\nControl 클래스 내에서 SelectableControl의 인스턴스를 통해 state private 멤버에 접근할 수 있습니다.실제로 SelectableControl은 알려진 대로 select 메서드를 가진 Control과 같은 역할을 합니다.Button과 TextBox 클래스는 SelectableControl의 하위 타입입니다 (왜냐하면 둘 다 Control을 상속받으며 select 메서드를 가지기 때문입니다).그러나 Image 클래스와 Location 클래스는 그렇지 않습니다.\n"},"pages/Classes.html":{"url":"pages/Classes.html","title":"클래스","keywords":"","body":"소개 (Introduction)\n전통적인 JavaScript는 재사용 가능한 컴포넌트를 만들기 위해 함수와 프로토 타입 기반의 상속을 사용하지만 클래스가 함수를 상속하고 객체가 이러한 클래스에서 구축되는 객체 지향 접근 방식에 익숙하지 않은 개발자들에게는 다소 어색함을 느낄 수 있습니다.ECMAScript6로도 알려진 ECMAScript 2015년을 시작으로 JavaScript 개발자는 이 객체 지향 클래스 기반 접근 방식을 사용하여 응용 프로그램을 구축 할 수 있습니다.TypeScript에서는 개발자가 이 기술을 사용하고 다음 JavaScript 버전을 기다리지 않고도 모든 메이저 브라우저와 플랫폼에서 작동하는 JavaScript로 컴파일 할 수 있습니다.\n클래스 (Classes)\n간단한 클래스 기반 예제를 살펴보겠습니다:\nclass Greeter {\n    greeting: string;\n    constructor(message: string) {\n        this.greeting = message;\n    }\n    greet() {\n        return \"Hello, \" + this.greeting;\n    }\n}\n\nlet greeter = new Greeter(\"world\");\n\n이전에 C# 또는 Java를 사용한 적이 있는 경우 구문이 익숙하게 보여야 합니다.새로운 클래스인 Greeter을 선언합니다.\n이 클래스에는 3개의 멤버가 있습니다: greeting 프로퍼티와 생성자 그리고 greet 메서드가 있습니다.\n클래스의 멤버 중 하나를 참조할 때 클래스에서 this를 앞에 접두어로 붙입니다.\n이것은 멤버에 접근하는 것을 뜻합니다.\n마지막 줄에서는 new를 사용하여 Greeter 클래스의 인스턴스를 만듭니다.이것은 이전에 정의한 생성자를 호출하여 Greeter 형태의 새 객체를 만들고 생성자를 실행하여 이를 초기화합니다.\n상속 (Inheritance)\nTypeScript에서는 일반적인 객체 지향 패턴을 사용할 수 있습니다.클래스 기반 프로그래밍에서 가장 기본적인 패턴 중 하나는 상속을 사용하여 기존 클래스를 확장하여 새로운 클래스를 생성할 수 있다는 것입니다.\n예제를 살펴보겠습니다:\nclass Animal {\n    move(distanceInMeters: number = 0) {\n        console.log(`Animal moved ${distanceInMeters}m.`);\n    }\n}\n\nclass Dog extends Animal {\n    bark() {\n        console.log('Woof! Woof!');\n    }\n}\n\nconst dog = new Dog();\ndog.bark();\ndog.move(10);\ndog.bark();\n\n이 예제는 가장 기본적인 상속 기능을 보여줍니다: 클래스는 기본 클래스에서 속성과 메서드를 상속받습니다.여기서 Dog는 extends 키워드를 사용하여 Animal 기본 클래스에서 유래된 파생 클래스입니다.파생 클래스는 종종 하위 클래스(subclasses) 라고 하며 기본 클래스는 슈퍼 클래스(superclasses) 라고도 합니다.\nDog는 Animal로부터 기능을 확장시키기 때문에 bark()와 move() 둘 다 할 수 있는 Dog의 인스턴스를 만들 수 있었습니다.\n이제 좀 더 복잡한 예제를 살펴보겠습니다.\nclass Animal {\n    name: string;\n    constructor(theName: string) { this.name = theName; }\n    move(distanceInMeters: number = 0) {\n        console.log(`${this.name} moved ${distanceInMeters}m.`);\n    }\n}\n\nclass Snake extends Animal {\n    constructor(name: string) { super(name); }\n    move(distanceInMeters = 5) {\n        console.log(\"Slithering...\");\n        super.move(distanceInMeters);\n    }\n}\n\nclass Horse extends Animal {\n    constructor(name: string) { super(name); }\n    move(distanceInMeters = 45) {\n        console.log(\"Galloping...\");\n        super.move(distanceInMeters);\n    }\n}\n\nlet sam = new Snake(\"Sammy the Python\");\nlet tom: Animal = new Horse(\"Tommy the Palomino\");\n\nsam.move();\ntom.move(34);\n\n이 예제는 앞서 언급하지 않은 몇 가지 다른 기능을 다룹니다.이번에도 Animal의 새로운 하위 클래스인 Horse과 Snake을 만드는 extends 키워드가 등장합니다.\n이전 예제와의 한 가지 다른 점은 생성자 함수를 포함하는 각 파생 클래스가 기본 클래스의 생성자를 실행할 super()를 호출해야한다는 것입니다.게다가 생성자 내에서 this에 있는 프로퍼티에 접근하기 전에 항상 super()를 호출해야 합니다.이것은 TypeScript가 적용할 중요한 규칙입니다.\n또한 이 예제에서는 기본 클래스의 메서드를 하위 클래스에 특화된 메서드를 오버라이드 하는 방법도 보여 줍니다.\n여기에서 Snake와 Horse는 Animal의 move를 오버라이드하고 각 클래스에 고유한 기능을 부여하는 move 메서드를 만듭니다.\ntom은 Animal로 선언되었지만 Horse의 값을 가지므로 tom.move(34)를 호출하면 Horse의 오버라이딩 메서드가 호출됩니다:\nSlithering...\nSammy the Python moved 5m.\nGalloping...\nTommy the Palomino moved 34m.\n\nPublic, private, 그리고 protected 지정자 (Public, private, and protected modifiers)\n기본적인 Public (Public by default)\n예를 들어 프로그램을 통해 선언된 멤버들에 자유롭게 접근할 수 있었습니다.\n다른 언어의 클래스에 익숙하다면 위의 예제에서 public을 사용하지 않아도 된다는 사실을 알았을 것입니다.예를 들어 C#의 경우 각 멤버를 public으로 표시하도록 명시해야합니다.\nTypeScript에서는 기본적으로 각 멤버가 public입니다.\n그럼에도 불구하고 public를 멤버를 명시적으로 표시할 수 있습니다.이전 섹션의 Animal 클래스를 다음과 같이 작성할 수 있었습니다:\nclass Animal {\n    public name: string;\n    public constructor(theName: string) { this.name = theName; }\n    public move(distanceInMeters: number) {\n        console.log(`${this.name} moved ${distanceInMeters}m.`);\n    }\n}\n\nprivate 이해하기 (Understanding private)\n멤버가 private으로 표시되면 그 멤버를 포함하는 클래스의 외부에서는 접근할 수 없습니다. 예 :\nclass Animal {\n    private name: string;\n    constructor(theName: string) { this.name = theName; }\n}\n\nnew Animal(\"Cat\").name; // 오류: 'name'은 private이다;\n\nTypeScript는 구조적인 타입의 시스템입니다.두 개의 다른 타입을 비교할 때 그것들이 어디서 왔는지에 관계없이 모든 멤버의 타입이 호환 가능하다면 그 타입 자체가 호환성(compatible)이 있다고 말합니다.\n그러나 private 및 protected멤버가 있는 타입을 비교할 때 이러한 타입들은 다르게 처리합니다.\n호환성(compatible)이 있는 것으로 판단되는 두 가지 타입 중 private멤버가 있는 경우 다른 멤버는 동일한 선언에서 유래된 private멤버가 있어야 합니다.이것은 protected멤버에도 적용됩니다.\n실제로 이러한 기능이 어떻게 작동하는지를 더 잘 알아보기 위한 예를 살펴보겠습니다:\nclass Animal {\n    private name: string;\n    constructor(theName: string) { this.name = theName; }\n}\n\nclass Rhino extends Animal {\n    constructor() { super(\"Rhino\"); }\n}\n\nclass Employee {\n    private name: string;\n    constructor(theName: string) { this.name = theName; }\n}\n\nlet animal = new Animal(\"Goat\");\nlet rhino = new Rhino();\nlet employee = new Employee(\"Bob\");\n\nanimal = rhino;\nanimal = employee; // 오류: 'Animal'과 'Employee'는 호환되지 않습니다.\n\n이 예제에서는 Animal과 Rhino가 있습니다. Rhino는 Animal의 하위 클래스입니다.또한 구체적으로 Animal과 같아 보이는 Employee라는 새로운 클래스를 가지고 있습니다.이러한 클래스들의 인스턴스들을 만들고 서로를 할당하여 어떠한 일이 발생하는지 봅시다.\nAnimal과 Rhino는 Animal의 private name: string 선언으로부터 private의 형태를 공유하기 때문에 호환됩니다.그러나 Employee의 경우는 그렇지 않습니다.\nEmployee를 Animal에 할당하려고 할 때 이 타입들은 호환되지 않는다는 오류가 발생합니다.Employee도 name이라는 private 멤버가 있지만 Animal에서 선언한 것이 아닙니다.\nprotected 이해하기 (Understanding protected)\nprotected 지정자는 private 지정자와 매우 유사하게 동작합니다.단 protected 멤버도 선언된 파생 클래스의 인스턴스에서 접근할 수 있습니다.  \n예를 들어\nclass Person {\n    protected name: string;\n    constructor(name: string) { this.name = name; }\n}\n\nclass Employee extends Person {\n    private department: string;\n\n    constructor(name: string, department: string) {\n        super(name);\n        this.department = department;\n    }\n\n    public getElevatorPitch() {\n        return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I work in ${this.department}.`;\n    }\n}\n\nlet howard = new Employee(\"Howard\", \"Sales\");\nconsole.log(howard.getElevatorPitch());\nconsole.log(howard.name); // 오류\n\nPerson의 외부에서 name을 사용할 수는 없지만 Employee는 Person으로부터 파생되기 때문에 Employee의 인스턴스 메서드 내에서 여전히 사용할 수 있습니다.\n생성자 또한 protected로 표시될 수도 있습니다.즉 클래스를 포함하는 클래스 외부에서 클래스를 인스턴스화할 수는 없지만 확장될 수는 있습니다.\n예를 들어\nclass Person {\n    protected name: string;\n    protected constructor(theName: string) { this.name = theName; }\n}\n\n// Employee는 Person을 확장할 수 있습니다\nclass Employee extends Person {\n    private department: string;\n\n    constructor(name: string, department: string) {\n        super(name);\n        this.department = department;\n    }\n\n    public getElevatorPitch() {\n        return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I work in ${this.department}.`;\n    }\n}\n\nlet howard = new Employee(\"Howard\", \"Sales\");\nlet john = new Person(\"John\"); // 오류: 'Person'의 생성자는 protected입니다.\n\nReadonly 지정자 (Readonly modifier)\nreadonly 키워드를 사용하여 프로퍼티들을 읽기 전용으로 만들 수 있습니다.\n읽기 전용 프로퍼티들은 선언 또는 생성자에서 초기화해야합니다.\nclass Octopus {\n    readonly name: string;\n    readonly numberOfLegs: number = 8;\n    constructor (theName: string) {\n        this.name = theName;\n    }\n}\nlet dad = new Octopus(\"Man with the 8 strong legs\");\ndad.name = \"Man with the 3-piece suit\"; // 오류! name은 readonly입니다.\n\n매개변수 프로퍼티 (Parameter properties)\n마지막 예제의 Octopus 클래스에서 readonly 멤버 name과 생성자 매개변수 theName을 선언했습니다.그 다음 바로 name을 theName으로 설정했습니다.\n이것은 매우 일반적인 방법입니다.매개변수 프로퍼티(Parameter properties) 를 사용하면 한 곳에서 멤버를 생성하고 초기화할 수 있습니다.다음은 매개 변수 프로퍼티를 사용하여 이전에 Octopus 클래스를 추가적으로 수정합니다:\nclass Octopus {\n    readonly numberOfLegs: number = 8;\n    constructor(readonly name: string) {\n    }\n}\n\ntheName을 어떻게 삭제했는지 확인하고 생성자에서 readonly name : string 매개 변수를 사용해 멤버 name을 생성하고 초기화할 수 있습니다.\n선언과 할당을 하나의 장소로 통합했습니다.\n매개변수 프로퍼티는 접근 지정자(accessibility modifier) 또는 readonly 또는 둘 모두로 생성자 매개변수를 접두어로 붙여 선언합니다.매개 변수 프로퍼티에 private을 사용하면 private 멤버가 선언되고 초기화됩니다.마찬가지로 public와 protected 그리고 readonly도 마찬가지입니다.\n접근자 (Accessors)\nTypeScript는 객체의 멤버에 대한 접근을 인터셉트하는 방법으로 getters/setters를 지원합니다.이것을 통해 각 객체에서 멤버에 접근하는 방법을 세부적으로 제어할 수 있습니다.\n간단한 클래스에 get과 set을 사용하도록 변환해봅시다.\n먼저 getter와 setter가 없는 예제부터 시작합시다.\nclass Employee {\n    fullName: string;\n}\n\nlet employee = new Employee();\nemployee.fullName = \"Bob Smith\";\nif (employee.fullName) {\n    console.log(employee.fullName);\n}\n\n사람들이 임의로 fullName을 직접 설정하는 것은 매우 편리하지만 기분 내키는 대로 이름을 바꿀 수 있다면 문제를 일으킬 수 있습니다\n이 버전에서는 employee를 수정할 수 있도록 하기 전에 사용자가 passcode를 사용할 수 있는지 확인합니다.이를 위해 passcode를 확인할 fullName에 대한 직접적인 권한을 set으로 교체합니다.앞의 예제가 계속해서 원활하게 작동하도록 하기 위해 그에 상응하는 get을 추가합니다.\nlet passcode = \"secret passcode\";\n\nclass Employee {\n    private _fullName: string;\n\n    get fullName(): string {\n        return this._fullName;\n    }\n\n    set fullName(newName: string) {\n        if (passcode && passcode == \"secret passcode\") {\n            this._fullName = newName;\n        }\n        else {\n            console.log(\"오류 : employee의 무단 업데이트!\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nlet employee = new Employee();\nemployee.fullName = \"Bob Smith\";\nif (employee.fullName) {\n    console.log(employee.fullName);\n}\n\n접근자가 passcode를 확인하고 있다는 것을 입증하기 위해 passcode를 수정하고 passcode가 일치하지 않을 경우 employee에게 업데이트 권한이 없다는 경고 메시지를 받을 수 있습니다.\n접근자에 대해 알아야 할 몇 가지 주의사항:\n첫째, 접근자를 사용하려면 ECMAScript5 이상을 출력하도록 컴파일러를 설정해야 합니다.\nECMAScript3 다운그레이드는 지원되지 않습니다.\n둘째, get과 set을 가진 접근자는 자동적으로 readonly로 추론됩니다.이것은 코드에서 .d.ts 파일을 생성할 때 유용합니다. 왜냐하면 프로퍼티를 변경할 수 없다는 것을 알 수 있기 때문입니다.\n정적 프로퍼티 (Static Properties)\n지금까지는 인스턴스의 클래스 멤버들에 대해서만 이야기했습니다.인스턴스는 인스턴스화될 때 객체에서 나타납니다.또한 인스턴스가 아닌 클래스 자체에 볼 수 있는 스태틱 멤버도 생성할 수 있습니다.\n이 예제에서는 모든 grid의 일반적인 값이기 때문에 origin에 스태틱을 사용합니다.각 인스턴스는 클래스의 이름을 미리 정의하여 이 값에 접근합니다.인스턴스의 접근자 앞에 this. 를 추가하는 것과 비슷하게 스태틱 접근자 앞에 Grid를 추가합니다.\nclass Grid {\n    static origin = {x: 0, y: 0};\n    calculateDistanceFromOrigin(point: {x: number; y: number;}) {\n        let xDist = (point.x - Grid.origin.x);\n        let yDist = (point.y - Grid.origin.y);\n        return Math.sqrt(xDist * xDist + yDist * yDist) / this.scale;\n    }\n    constructor (public scale: number) { }\n}\n\nlet grid1 = new Grid(1.0);  // 1x scale\nlet grid2 = new Grid(5.0);  // 5x scale\n\nconsole.log(grid1.calculateDistanceFromOrigin({x: 10, y: 10}));\nconsole.log(grid2.calculateDistanceFromOrigin({x: 10, y: 10}));\n\n추상 클래스 (Abstract Classes)\n추상 클래스는 다른 클래스가 파생될 수 있는 기본 클래스입니다.추상 클래스는 직접적으로 인스턴스화할 수 없습니다.인터페이스와 달리 추상 클래스는 클래스의 멤버에 대한 구현 세부 정보를 포함할 수 있습니다.abstract 키워드는 추상 클래스뿐만 아니라 추상 클래스 내의 추상 메서드를 정의하는 데 사용됩니다.\nabstract class Animal {\n    abstract makeSound(): void;\n    move(): void {\n        console.log(\"roaming the earth...\");\n    }\n}\n\nabstract으로 표시된 추상 클래스 내의 메서드는 구현을 포함하지 않으므로 파생된 클래스에서 구현해야 합니다.추상 메서드는 인터페이스 메서드와 유사한 구문을 사용합니다.둘 다 메서드 본문을 포함하지 않고 메소드를 정의합니다.그러나 추상 메서드는 abstract 키워드를 포함해야 하며 선택적으로 접근 지정자를 포함할 수 있습니다.\nabstract class Department {\n\n    constructor(public name: string) {\n    }\n\n    printName(): void {\n        console.log(\"Department name: \" + this.name);\n    }\n\n    abstract printMeeting(): void; // 파생된 클래스에서 구현해야 합니다.\n}\n\nclass AccountingDepartment extends Department {\n\n    constructor() {\n        super(\"Accounting and Auditing\"); // 파생된 클래스의 생성자는 super()를 호출해야합니다.\n    }\n\n    printMeeting(): void {\n        console.log(\"The Accounting Department meets each Monday

functions)\nTypeScript에서 클래스를 선언하면 실제로 여러 선언이 동시에 생성됩니다.\n첫 번째 클래스의 인스턴스 타입입니다.\nclass Greeter {\n    greeting: string;\n    constructor(message: string) {\n        this.greeting = message;\n    }\n    greet() {\n        return \"Hello, \" + this.greeting;\n    }\n}\n\nlet greeter: Greeter;\ngreeter = new Greeter(\"world\");\nconsole.log(greeter.greet());\n\n여기서 let greeter: Greeter라고 할 때 Greeter 클래스의 인스턴스 타입으로 Greeter를 사용합니다.이것는 다른 객체 지향 언어를 사용하는 개발자에게는 거의 두 번째 특성입니다.\n또한 생성자 함수라고 부르는 또 다른 값을 생성하고 있습니다.\n이것은 클래스의 인스턴스를 new 할 때 호출되는 함수입니다.\n실제로 이 과정이 어떻게 진행되고 있는지 확인하기 위해 위의 예제에서 생성된 JavaScript를 살펴보겠습니다:\nlet Greeter = (function () {\n    function Greeter(message) {\n        this.greeting = message;\n    }\n    Greeter.prototype.greet = function () {\n        return \"Hello, \" + this.greeting;\n    };\n    return Greeter;\n})();\n\nlet greeter;\ngreeter = new Greeter(\"world\");\nconsole.log(greeter.greet());\n\n여기서 let Greeter는 생성자 함수를 할 받게 될 것입니다.new를 호출하고 이 함수를 실행하면 클래스의 인스턴스를 얻습니다.생성자 함수에는 클래스의 모든 스태틱 멤버 또한 포함됩니다.각각의 클래스를 생각하는 또 다른 방법은 인스턴스 측면과 스태틱 측면이 있다는 것입니다.\n이 차이를 보여 주기 위해 예제를 약간 수정해 보겠습니다:\nclass Greeter {\n    static standardGreeting = \"Hello, there\";\n    greeting: string;\n    greet() {\n        if (this.greeting) {\n            return \"Hello, \" + this.greeting;\n        }\n        else {\n            return Greeter.standardGreeting;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nlet greeter1: Greeter;\ngreeter1 = new Greeter();\nconsole.log(greeter1.greet());\n\nlet greeterMaker: typeof Greeter = Greeter;\ngreeterMaker.standardGreeting = \"Hey there!\";\n\nlet greeter2: Greeter = new greeterMaker();\nconsole.log(greeter2.greet());\n\n이 예제에서 greeter1은 이전과 비슷하게 작동합니다.Greeter 클래스를 인스턴스화하고 이 객체를 사용합니다.이것은 전에 본 적이 있는 것입니다.\n그런 다음 그 클래스를 직접 사용합니다.여기서 greeterMaker라는 새로운 변수를 만듭니다.이 변수는 클래스 자체를 유지하거나 생성자 함수라고 하는 또 다른 방법으로 설명합니다.  \n여기서는 typeof Greeter를 사용합니다.즉 \"인스턴스 타입이 아닌 \"Greeter 클래스 자체의 타입을 제공합니다\".또는 더 정확하게 생성자 함수의 타입인 \"Greeter라는 symbol 타입을 제공합니다\".이 타입에는 Greeter 클래스의 인스턴스를 생성하는 생성자와 함께 Greeter의 모든 스태틱 멤버가 포함됩니다.greeterMaker에 new를 사용하는 것을 보여 주며 Greeter의 새로운 인스턴스를 생성하고 이전과 같이 호출합니다.\n클래스를 인터페이스로 사용하기 (Using a class as an interface)\n앞서 언급한 것처럼 클래스 선언은 두 가지를 생성합니다: 클래스의 인스턴스를 나타내는 타입과 생성자 함수클래스는 타입을 작성하기 때문에 인터페이스를 사용할 수 있는 동일한 위치에서 타입을 사용할 수 있습니다.\nclass Point {\n    x: number;\n    y: number;\n}\n\ninterface Point3d extends Point {\n    z: number;\n}\n\nlet point3d: Point3d = {x: 1, y: 2, z: 3};\n\n"},"pages/Functions.html":{"url":"pages/Functions.html","title":"함수","keywords":"","body":"소개 (Introduction)\n함수는 JavaScript의 모든 애플리케이션을 구성하는 기본 요소입니다.클래스는 추상화 계층, 클래스, 정보 은닉 및 모듈을 구축하는 방법입니다.TypeScript에서는 클래스와 네임 스페이스 그리고 모듈이 있지만 함수는 그럼에도 불구하고 작업 방법을 설명하는 데 중요한 역할을 합니다.또한 TypeScript는 표준 JavaScript 기능에 몇가지 새로운 기능을 추가하여 작업을 더 쉽게 해 줍니다.\n함수 (Functions)\nJavaScript와 마찬가지로 TypeScript 함수는 기명 함수 또는 익명 함수로 만들 수 있습니다.이를 통해 API의 함수 목록을 작성하든 다른 함수에 전달할 일회성 함수이든 애플리케이션에 가장 적합한 접근 방법을 선택할 수 있습니다.\n이 두가지 접근 방식이 JavaScript에서 어떻게 보이는지 빠르게 요약하면:\n// 기명 함수\nfunction add(x, y) {\n    return x + y;\n}\n\n// 익명 함수\nlet myAdd = function(x, y) { return x + y; };\n\nJavaScript에서와 마찬가지로 함수는 함수 본문 외부의 변수를 참조할 수 있습니다.그렇게 할 때 이러한 변수들을 capture라고 말합니다.이 기법의 사용 방법과 사용할 때의 절충 사항을 이해하는 것은 이번 장의 범위를 벗어나지만캡처의 메커니즘이 JavaScript와 TypeScript에 얼마나 중요한 부분인지 확실히 이해해야 합니다.\nlet z = 100;\n\nfunction addToZ(x, y) {\n    return x + y + z;\n}\n\n함수의 타입 (Function Types)\n함수 작성하기 (Typing the function)\n앞에서 살펴본 간단한 예제에 타입을 추가해보겠습니다.\nfunction add(x: number, y: number): number {\n    return x + y;\n}\n\nlet myAdd = function(x: number, y: number): number { return x + y; };\n\n각 매개변수에 타입을 추가 한 다음 함수 자체에 타입을 추가하여 반환 타입을 추가할 수 있습니다.TypeScript는 리턴문를 보고 반환 타입을 파악할 수 있기 때문에 대부분 선택적으로 반환 타입을 생략할 수 있습니다.\n함수 타입 작성하기 (Writing the function type)\n이제 함수를 작성했으므로 함수 타입의 각 부분을 살펴보면서 함수의 전체 타입을 작성해보겠습니다.\nlet myAdd: (x: number, y: number) => number =\n    function(x: number, y: number): number { return x + y; };\n\n함수의 타입은 두개의 파트로 나뉩니다: 인수의 타입과 반환 타입.전체 함수 타입을 작성할 때 두 파트가 모두 필요합니다.매개변수 타입과 같이 매개변수 목록을 기록하여 각 매개변수에 이름과 타입을 지정합니다.이 이름은 가독성을 돕기 위한 것입니다.\n위의 코드를 다음과 같이 작성할 수 있습니다:\nlet myAdd: (baseValue: number, increment: number) => number =\n    function(x: number, y: number): number { return x + y; };\n\n매개변수 타입이 정렬되어 있는 한 함수의 타입에 매개변수를 제공하는 이름에 관계 없이 매개변수 타입이 유효한 타입으로 간주됩니다.\n두 번째 파트는 반환 타입입니다.매개변수와 반환 타입 사이에 굵은 화살표(=>)를 사용하여 반환 타입을 명확하게 합니다.앞서 언급한 것처럼 이것은 함수 타입의 필수적인 부분이므로 함수가 값을 반환하지 않는 경우에는 반환 값을 남겨 두지 않고 void를 사용합니다.\n주의사항, 매개변수와 반환 타입만 함수 타입을 구성합니다.캡처된 변수는 타입에 반영되지 않습니다.실제로 캡처된 변수는 함수의 \"숨겨진 상태\"의 일부이며 해당 API를 구성하지 않습니다.\n타입 추론 (Inferring the types)\n예를 들어 TypeScript 컴파일러는 한쪽에는 타입이 있지만 다른 한쪽에 타입이 없는 경우 그 타입을 이해할 수 없다는 것을 알게 됩니다:\n// myAdd는 완벽하게 함수 타입을 가지고 있습니다.\nlet myAdd = function(x: number, y: number): number { return  x + y; };\n\n// 매개변수 'x'와 'y'에는 number 타입이 있습니다.\nlet myAdd: (baseValue: number, increment: number) => number =\n    function(x, y) { return x + y; };\n\n이것을 타입 추론의 한 종류인 \"상황적 타이핑(Contextual Typing)\"이라고 합니다.\n이를 통해 프로그램을 계속 유지하는 데 드는 노력을 줄일 수 있습니다.\n선택적 매개변수와 기본 매개변수 (Optional and Default Parameters)\nTypeScript에서는 모든 매개변수가 함수에 필요하다고 가정합니다.null 또는 undefined가 주어질 수 없다는 것을 의미하는 것이 아니라 함수가 호출될 때 컴파일러가 각 매개변수에 값을 제공했는지 확인한다는 것입니다.또한 컴파일러는 이러한 매개변수들이 함수로 전달되는 유일한 매개변수라고 가정합니다.간단히 말해서 함수에 주어진 인수의 수는 그 함수에서 기대하는 매개변수의 수와 일치해야 합니다.\nfunction buildName(firstName: string, lastName: string) {\n    return firstName + \" \" + lastName;\n}\n\nlet result1 = buildName(\"Bob\");                  // 오류, 너무 적은 매개변수\nlet result2 = buildName(\"Bob\", \"Adams\", \"Sr.\");  // 오류, 너무 많은 매개변수\nlet result3 = buildName(\"Bob\", \"Adams\");         // 아, 딱 맞습니다\n\nJavaScript에서 모든 매개변수는 선택 사항이며 매개변수를 원하는 대로 사용하지 않을 수 있습니다.그렇게 되면 그 매개변수들의 값은 undefined입니다.\nTypeScript에서 선택적인 매개변수를 사용하려면 선택적으로 사용하려는 매개변수의 끝에 ?를 추가하세요.\n예를 들어 위에서 사용한 lastName 매개변수를 선택적으로 사용할 수 있도록 합니다:\nfunction buildName(firstName: string, lastName?: string) {\n    if (lastName)\n        return firstName + \" \" + lastName;\n    else\n        return firstName;\n}\n\nlet result1 = buildName(\"Bob\");                  // 올바르게 작동합니다\nlet result2 = buildName(\"Bob\", \"Adams\", \"Sr.\");  // 오류, 너무 많은 매개변수\nlet result3 = buildName(\"Bob\", \"Adams\");         // 아, 딱 맞습니다\n\n모든 선택적 매개변수는 필수 매개변수를 따라와야 합니다.last name 대신 first name을 선택적 매개변수로 만들고 싶다면 함수의 매개변수 순서를 변경해야 합니다.즉 목록의 first name을 마지막에 넣어야합니다.\nTypeScript에서 사용자가 매개변수를 제공하지 않거나 사용자가 대신 undefined를 전달하더라도 매개변수가에 할당되는 값을 설정할 수 있습니다.이것을 기본 매개변수(default-initialized parameters)라고 합니다.\n앞의 예제를 따라 last name의 기본값을 \"Smith\"로 설정해 보겠습니다.\nfunction buildName(firstName: string, lastName = \"Smith\") {\n    return firstName + \" \" + lastName;\n}\n\nlet result1 = buildName(\"Bob\");                  // 올바르게 작동하며 \"Bob Smith\"를 반환합니다\nlet result2 = buildName(\"Bob\", undefined);       // 여전히 작동하며 \"Bob Smith\"를 반환합니다.\nlet result3 = buildName(\"Bob\", \"Adams\", \"Sr.\");  // 오류, 너무 많은 매개변수\nlet result4 = buildName(\"Bob\", \"Adams\");         // 아, 딱 맞습니다\n\n필수 매개변수의 뒤에 오는 기본 매개변수는 선택적 매개변수로 취급되어 함수를 호출할 때 선택적 매개변수처럼 생략할 수 있습니다.이것은 선택적 매개변수와 후행 기본 매개변수가 해당 타입의 공통점을 공유한다는 것을 의미하므로  \n둘 다\nfunction buildName(firstName: string, lastName?: string) {\n    // ...\n}\n\n그리고\nfunction buildName(firstName: string, lastName = \"Smith\") {\n    // ...\n}\n\n(firstName: string, lastName?: string) => string 동일한 타입을 공유합니다.lastName의 기본 값은 타입에서 사라지고 매개변수가 선택 사항이라는 사실만 남겨졌습니다.\n일반 선택적 매개변수와 달리 기본 매개변수는 필수 매개변수 뒤에 나올 필요가 없습니다.기본 매개변수가 필수 매개변수 앞에 오는 경우 사용자는 명시적으로 undefined를 전달하여 기본 초기화된 값을 가져와야 합니다.\n예를 들어 firstName에 기본 초기화만 있는 마지막 예제를 작성할 수 있습니다:\nfunction buildName(firstName = \"Will\", lastName: string) {\n    return firstName + \" \" + lastName;\n}\n\nlet result1 = buildName(\"Bob\");                  // 오류, 너무 적은 매개변수\nlet result2 = buildName(\"Bob\", \"Adams\", \"Sr.\");  // 오류, 너무 많은 매개변수\nlet result3 = buildName(\"Bob\", \"Adams\");         // 좋아요 \"Bob Adams\"를 반환합니다\nlet result4 = buildName(undefined, \"Adams\");     // 좋아요 \"Will Adams\"를 반환합니다\n\n나머지 매개변수 (Rest Parameters)\n필수 매개변수와 선택적 매개변수 그리고 기본 매개변수 모두 공통점이 하나 있습니다: 한 번에 하나의 매개변수에 대해 이야기합니다.때로는 여러 매개변수를 그룹으로 사용하거나 함수가 마지막으로 가져올 매개변수의 수를 모를 수 있습니다.JavaScript에서는 모든 함수 본문에서 볼 수 있는 arguments를 사용하여 인수를 직접 사용할 수 있습니다.\nTypeScript에서는 다음과 같은 인수를 변수로 함께 모을수 있습니다:\nfunction buildName(firstName: string, ...restOfName: string[]) {\n    return firstName + \" \" + restOfName.join(\" \");\n}\n\nlet employeeName = buildName(\"Joseph\", \"Samuel\", \"Lucas\", \"MacKinzie\");\n\n나머지 매개변수는 무한적인 수의 선택적 매개변수로 처리됩니다.Rest 매개변수에 인수를 전달할 때는 원하는 만큼 사용할 수 있으며 심지어 통과할 수 없습니다.컴파일러는 줄임표 (...) 다음에 전달된 인수들을 배열을 작성하여 함수에서 사용할 수 있습니다.\n줄임표(...)는 나머지 매개변수가 있는 함수의 타입에도 사용됩니다:\nfunction buildName(firstName: string, ...restOfName: string[]) {\n    return firstName + \" \" + restOfName.join(\" \");\n}\n\nlet buildNameFun: (fname: string, ...rest: string[]) => string = buildName;\n\nthis\nJavaScript에서 this를 사용법을 배우는 것은 일종의 통과 의례입니다.TypeScript는 JavaScript의 상위 집합이기 때문에 TypeScript 개발자들도 this을 사용하는 방법과 올바르게 사용되고 있지 않을 때를 찾아내는 방법을 배워야 합니다.JavaScript에서 this가 어떻게 작동하는지 알아야 한다면 Yehuda Katz의 Understanding JavaScript Function Invocation and \"this\"를 먼저 읽어보세요.Yehuda의 글에는 this의 내부 동작을 잘 설명하기 때문에 여기서는 기본적인 내용만 다룰 것입니다.\nthis와 화살표 함수 (this and arrow functions)\nJavaScript에서 this는 함수가 호출될 때 설정되는 변수입니다.매우 강력하고 유연한 기능이지만 함수가 실행되는 상황에 대해 항상 알고 있어야 하는 시간이 듭니다.특히 함수를 반환하거나 함수를 인수로 전달할 때 악명 높을 정도로 혼란스럽습니다.\n예제를 살펴보겠습니다:\nlet deck = {\n    suits: [\"hearts\", \"spades\", \"clubs\", \"diamonds\"],\n    cards: Array(52),\n    createCardPicker: function() {\n        return function() {\n            let pickedCard = Math.floor(Math.random() * 52);\n            let pickedSuit = Math.floor(pickedCard / 13);\n\n            return {suit: this.suits[pickedSuit], card: pickedCard % 13};\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nlet cardPicker = deck.createCardPicker();\nlet pickedCard = cardPicker();\n\nalert(\"card: \" + pickedCard.card + \" of \" + pickedCard.suit);\n\ncreateCardPicker는 자체적으로 함수를 반환하는 함수입니다.예제를 실행하려고 하면 alert 대신 오류가 발생합니다.createCardPicker에 의해 생성된 함수에서 사용되는 this가 deck 객체 대신에 window로 설정되어 있기 때문입니다.왜냐하면 cardPicker()는 자기 자신을 호출하기 때문입니다.이와 같이 최상위 비-메서드 구문 호출은 this에 window를 사용합니다.(주의사항 : 엄격모드(strict mode)에서 this는 window보다는 undefined가 될 것입니다).\n나중에 사용할 함수를 반환하기 전에 함수에 올바른 this가 연결되도록하여 이를 해결할 수 있습니다.\n이렇게하면 나중에 어떻게 사용되든 상관없이 원래의 deck객체를 볼 수 있습니다.이를 위해 함수 표현식을 ECMAScript 6의 화살표 구문으로 변경하여 사용합니다.화살표 함수는 호출된 곳이 아닌 함수가 생성 된 곳에서 this를 캡처합니다:\nlet deck = {\n    suits: [\"hearts\", \"spades\", \"clubs\", \"diamonds\"],\n    cards: Array(52),\n    createCardPicker: function() {\n        // 주의: 아래 줄은 이제 화살표 함수입니다. 여기에서 'this'를 캡처할 수 있습니다.\n        return () => {\n            let pickedCard = Math.floor(Math.random() * 52);\n            let pickedSuit = Math.floor(pickedCard / 13);\n\n            return {suit: this.suits[pickedSuit], card: pickedCard % 13};\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nlet cardPicker = deck.createCardPicker();\nlet pickedCard = cardPicker();\n\nalert(\"card: \" + pickedCard.card + \" of \" + pickedCard.suit);\n\n더 좋은 점은 컴파일러에 --noImplicitThis 신호를 넘겨주면 TypeScript가 실수를 했을 때 경고를 합니다.this.suits[pickedSuit]에서 this는 any 타입입니다.\nthis parameters\n불행히도 this.suits [pickedSuit]의 타입은 여전히any입니다.왜냐하면 this는 객체 리터럴 내부의 함수 표현식에서 왔기 때문입니다.이 문제를 해결하기 위해 명시적으로 this 매개변수를 제공할 수 있습니다.  \nthis 매개변수는 함수의 매개변수 목록에서 처음 나오는 가짜 매개변수입니다:\nfunction f(this: void) {\n    // 이 분리된 함수에서 'this'를 사용할 수 없는지 확인해보세요.\n}\n\n위의 예제에서 Card와 Deck에 몇 가지 인터페이스를 추가하여 타입을 더 명확하고 쉽게 재사용하기 쉽게 만들 수 있도록 하겠습니다\ninterface Card {\n    suit: string;\n    card: number;\n}\ninterface Deck {\n    suits: string[];\n    cards: number[];\n    createCardPicker(this: Deck): () => Card;\n}\nlet deck: Deck = {\n    suits: [\"hearts\", \"spades\", \"clubs\", \"diamonds\"],\n    cards: Array(52),\n    // 주의사항 : 이 함수는 이제 반드시 Deck 타입이어야합니다\n    createCardPicker: function(this: Deck) {\n        return () => {\n            let pickedCard = Math.floor(Math.random() * 52);\n            let pickedSuit = Math.floor(pickedCard / 13);\n\n            return {suit: this.suits[pickedSuit], card: pickedCard % 13};\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nlet cardPicker = deck.createCardPicker();\nlet pickedCard = cardPicker();\n\nalert(\"card: \" + pickedCard.card + \" of \" + pickedCard.suit);\n\n이제 TypeScript는createCardPicker가 Deck 객체에서 호출될 것으로 예상합니다.즉 this는 any가 아닌 Deck 타입입니다. 따라서 --noImplicitThis는 오류를 발생시키지 않습니다.\n콜백에서의 this 매개변수 (this parameters in callbacks)\n함수를 나중에 호출할 라이브러리에 전달할 때 콜백에서 this를 사용하여 오류가 발생할 수도 있습니다.왜냐하면 콜백을 호출하는 라이브러리가 표준 함수처럼 호출하기 때문에 this는 undefined가 될 것입니다.\n때때로 this 매개변수를 사용하여 콜백 오류를 방지할 수도 있습니다.\n첫 번째, 라이브러리 작성자는 콜백 타입에 this를 사용하여 annotate를 달아야 합니다:\ninterface UIElement {\n    addClickListener(onclick: (this: void, e: Event) => void): void;\n}\n\nthis : void는 addClickListener가 onclick이 this 타입을 필요로 하지 않는 함수라는 것을 의미합니다.\n두 번째, this를 사용하여 호출 코드와 함께 annotate를 달아야 합니다:\nclass Handler {\n    info: string;\n    onClickBad(this: Handler, e: Event) {\n        // 이런, 여기서 this를 사용했어요. 이 콜백을 사용하면 충돌으로 런타임 오류가 발생합니다.\n        this.info = e.message;\n    }\n}\nlet h = new Handler();\nuiElement.addClickListener(h.onClickBad); // 오류!\n\nthis가 annotated되어 있으면 onClickBad는 반드시 Handler의 인스턴스에서 호출되어야한다는 것을 명시해야 합니다.그런 다음 TypeScript는 addClickListener에 this : void가 있는 함수가 필요하다는 것을 발견합니다.오류를 해결하려면 this의 타입을 수정하세요:\nclass Handler {\n    info: string;\n    onClickGood(this: void, e: Event) {\n        // this의 타입이 void이기 때문에 여기서는 사용할 수 없습니다!\n        console.log('clicked!');\n    }\n}\nlet h = new Handler();\nuiElement.addClickListener(h.onClickGood);\n\nonClickGood는 this의 타입을 void로 지정하기 때문에 addClickListener에 전달할 수 있습니다.물론 this는 또한 this.info를 사용할 수 없다는 것을 의미합니다.두 가지 모두를 사용하려면 화살표 함수를 사용해야 합니다:\nclass Handler {\n    info: string;\n    onClickGood = (e: Event) => { this.info = e.message }\n}\n\n이것은 화살표 함수가 this를 캡처하지 않기 때문에 효과적입니다.때문에 기대하는 것 같이 항상 this : void를 넘겨줄 수 있습니다.\n단점은 Handler 타입의 객체마다 하나의 화살표 함수가 생성된다는 것입니다.반면에 메서드는 한 번만 만들어지고 핸들러의 프로토 타입에 소속됩니다.이러한 객체는 핸들러 타입의 모든 객체 사이에 공유됩니다.\n오버로드 (Overloads)\nJavaScript는 본질적으로 매우 동적인 언어입니다.단일 JavaScript 함수가 전달된 인수의 형태를 기반으로 서로 다른 타입의 객체를 반환하는 것은 드문 일이 아닙니다.\nlet suits = [\"hearts\", \"spades\", \"clubs\", \"diamonds\"];\n\nfunction pickCard(x): any {\n    // 객체 / 배열로 작업하고 있는지 확인해보세요\n    // 그렇다면 그것들은 덱을 주고 사용자는 카드를 선택할 것입니다.\n    if (typeof x == \"object\") {\n        let pickedCard = Math.floor(Math.random() * x.length);\n        return pickedCard;\n    }\n    // 그렇지 않으면 카드를 선택하게하세요.\n    else if (typeof x == \"number\") {\n        let pickedSuit = Math.floor(x / 13);\n        return { suit: suits[pickedSuit], card: x % 13 };\n    }\n}\n\nlet myDeck = [{ suit: \"diamonds\", card: 2 }, { suit: \"spades\", card: 10 }, { suit: \"hearts\", card: 4 }];\nlet pickedCard1 = myDeck[pickCard(myDeck)];\nalert(\"card: \" + pickedCard1.card + \" of \" + pickedCard1.suit);\n\nlet pickedCard2 = pickCard(15);\nalert(\"card: \" + pickedCard2.card + \" of \" + pickedCard2.suit);\n\n여기서 pickCard 함수는 사용자가 무엇을 전달했는지에 따라 두 개의 서로 다른 내용을 반환합니다.사용자가 deck를 나타내는 객체를 전달하면 함수가 card를 선택합니다.사용자가 card를 선택하면 그들이 선택한 card를 알려줍니다.하지만 이것을 어떻게 타입 시스템에 설명할까요?\n이에 대한 대답은 오버로드 목록과 동일한 함수에 대한 여러 함수 타입을 제공하는 것이다.이 목록은 컴파일러가 함수 호출을 해결하는 데 사용할 것입니다.pickCard가 받아들일 수 있는 것과 그것이 반환하는 것을 기술한 오버로드 목록을 작성해 보세요.\nlet suits = [\"hearts\", \"spades\", \"clubs\", \"diamonds\"];\n\nfunction pickCard(x: {suit: string; card: number; }[]): number;\nfunction pickCard(x: number): {suit: string; card: number; };\nfunction pickCard(x): any {\n    // 객체 / 배열로 작업하고 있는지 확인해보세요\n    // 그렇다면 그것들은 덱을 주고 사용자는 카드를 선택할 것입니다.\n    if (typeof x == \"object\") {\n        let pickedCard = Math.floor(Math.random() * x.length);\n        return pickedCard;\n    }\n    // 그렇지 않으면 카드를 선택하게하세요.\n    else if (typeof x == \"number\") {\n        let pickedSuit = Math.floor(x / 13);\n        return { suit: suits[pickedSuit], card: x % 13 };\n    }\n}\n\nlet myDeck = [{ suit: \"diamonds\", card: 2 }, { suit: \"spades\", card: 10 }, { suit: \"hearts\", card: 4 }];\nlet pickedCard1 = myDeck[pickCard(myDeck)];\nalert(\"card: \" + pickedCard1.card + \" of \" + pickedCard1.suit);\n\nlet pickedCard2 = pickCard(15);\nalert(\"card: \" + pickedCard2.card + \" of \" + pickedCard2.suit);\n\n이런 변화로 인해 오버로드가 pickCard 함수에 대한 타입-체크 호출을 제공합니다.\n컴파일러가 올바른 타입 검사를 선택하기 위해 기본 JavaScript와 비슷한 프로세스를 수행합니다.오버로드 목록을 살펴보고 제공된 매개변수를 사용하여 함수를 호출하는 첫 번째 오버로드 시도를 계속합니다.일치하는 것을 찾으면 이 오버로드를 올바른 오버로드로 선택합니다.이러한 이유 때문에 주문이 많아지면 가장 구체적인 것에서 가장 덜 구체적인 것으로 오버로드합니다.\nfunction pickCard (x) : any 조각은 오버로드 목록의 일부가 아니므로 두 개의 오버로드만 있습니다:하나는 객체를 취하고 하나는 숫자를 취합니다.pickCard를 다른 매개 변수 타입과 함께 호출하면 오류가 발생합니다.\n"},"pages/Generics.html":{"url":"pages/Generics.html","title":"제네릭","keywords":"","body":"소개 (Introduction)\n소프트웨어 공학의 주요 부분은 명확하고 일관된 API를 가질뿐만 아니라 재사용 가능한 구성 요소를 구축하는 것입니다. 현재의 데이터 뿐만 아니라

사용하는 것은 분명히 함수가 arg에 대한 모든 타입을 전달 받을 수 있게되지만 실제로 함수가 반환할 때 그 타입이 무엇이었는지에 대한 정보를 잃어버립니다. 만약 숫자를 인수로 전달하면 어떤 타입이든 반환횔 수 있다는 것을 알 수 있습니다.\n대신 어떤 타입이 반환될 것인지를 나타내는 데 사용할 수 있는 방식으로 인수 타입을 정하는 방법이 필요합니다. 여기서는 값이 아닌 타입을 처리하는 특별한 종류의 변수인 타입 변수(type variable)을 사용할 것입니다.\nfunction identity(arg: T): T {\n    return arg;\n}\n\nidentity 함수에 타입변수 T 를 추가했습니다.\n이 T 는 함수 사용자가 제공한 타입(예: number)를 캡처하여 나중에 해당 정보를 사용할 수 있도록 합니다. 또한 T 를 다시 반환 타입으로 사용합니다. 자세히 보면 인수와 반환 타입에 동일한 타입이 사용되는 것을 볼 수 있습니다. 이를 통해 함수의 안과 밖에서 타입에 대한 정보를 넘길 수 있습니다.\n이러한 모습의 identity 함수는 다양한 타입을 처리할 수 있기 때문에 일반적이라고 할 수 있습니다. any 를 사용하는 것과는 달리 인수와 반환 타입에 숫자를 사용하는 처음의 identity 함수와 동일합니다.(즉 어떠한 정보도 잃어버리지 않습니다)\n제네릭 identity 함수를 만든 후 두 가지 방법 중 하나로 호출 할 수 있습니다. 첫번째 방법은 타입 인수를 포함한 모든 인수를 함수에 전달하는 것입니다.\nlet output = identity(\"myString\");  // 반환 타입은 'string' 입니다.\n\n여기서는 함수 호출에 대한 인수 중 하나인 T 를 string 으로 명시적으로 정했으며 인수에는 () 를 사용하는 것과 달리 <> 를 사용했습니다.\n두번째 방법은 더 일반적인 방법이기도 합니다. 여기서는 타입 인수 추론(type argument inference) 를 사용합니다. 즉 함수에 전달하는 인수 타입에 따라 컴파일러가 자동으로 T 값을 설정합니다.\nlet output = identity(\"myString\");  // 반환 타입은 'string' 입니다.\n\n꺾쇠 괄호(<>) 안에 명시적으로 타입을 전달할 필요가 없습니다. 컴파일러는 그저 \"myString\" 의 값을 보고 T 를 그 타입으로 설정합니다.\n타입 인수 추론은 코드를 더 짧고 가독성 있게 유지하는 유용한 도구가 될 수 있지만 보다 복잡한 예제에서는 컴파일러가 타입을 추론하지 못하면 앞의 예제에서 했던 것 처럼 타입 인수를 명시적으로 전달해야 할 수도 있습니다.\n제네릭 타입 변수 (Generic Type Variables)\n제네릭을 사용하기 시작할 때  identity 와 같은 제네릭 함수를 만들면 컴파일러는 함수 내부에 제네릭으로 타입이 지정된 매개변수를 올바르게 사용하도록 합니다. 즉 실제로 이러한 매개변수를 모든 타입이 될 수 있는 것처럼 취급힙니다.\n앞에서 본 identity 함수를 보겠습니다.\nfunction identity(arg: T): T {\n    return arg;\n}\n\n각 호출과 함께 콘솔에 인수 arg 의 길이를 기록하고 싶다면 어떻게 해야할까요?\n이렇게 할지도 모릅니다:\nfunction loggingIdentity(arg: T): T {\n    console.log(arg.length);  // 오류 : T는 .length 메소드를 가지고 있지 않습니다.\n    return arg;\n}\n\n컴파일러는 arg 의 .length 멤버를 사용하고 있다는 오류를 주지만 arg 모듈에는 이 멤버가 없다고 할 수는 없습니다. 이전에 타입 변수가 모든 타입이 될 수 있다고 했습니다. 따라서 누군가 .length 멤버가 없는 number 를 전달 할 수 있을 것입니다.\n실제로 이 함수가 T 대신 T 배열을 처리한다고 가정해 봅시다. 그러면 배열을 처리할 수 있기 때문에 .length 멤버가 사용 가능해야 합니다. 다른 타입의 배열을 생성하는 함수로 이것을 설명하겠습니다:\nfunction loggingIdentity(arg: T[]): T[] {\n    console.log(arg.length);  // Array는 .length 멤버가 있습니다. 오류 없음.\n    return arg;\n}\n\nloggingIdentity 는 타입 매개 변수 T 를 인수로 받고 arg 는 T 배열이며 T 배열을 반환합니다. 숫자 배열을 인수로 넘기면 T 가 number 에 바인딩 되기 때문에 숫자 배열을 반환할 것입니다. 이렇게하면 모든 타입이 아닌 처리하고자 하는 타입의 일부로 제네릭 타입 변수 T 를 사용하여 유연성을 높일 수 있습니다.\n혹은 다음 예제와 같이 작성할 수 있습니다.\nfunction loggingIdentity(arg: Array): Array {\n    console.log(arg.length);  // Array는 .length 멤버가 있습니다. 오류 없음.\n    return arg;\n}\n\n이미 다른 언어의 타입 스타일에 대해 잘 알고 있을 것입니다. 다음장에서는 Array 와 같이 자신만의 제네릭 타입을 만드는 방법을 다룰 것입니다.\n제네릭 타입 (Generic Types)\n이전 장에서는 다양한 타입의 함수를 처리하는 제네릭 identity 함수를 만들었습니다. 이 장에서는 함수 자체의 타입과 제네릭 인터페이스를 만드는 방법에 대하여 살펴보겠습니다.\n제네릭 함수의 타입은 함수 선언과 비슷하게 타입 매개변수가 먼저 나열된 비 제네릭 함수의 형식과 같습니다.\nfunction identity(arg: T): T {\n    return arg;\n}\n\nlet myIdentity: (arg: T) => T = identity;\n\n타입 변수의 수와 타입 변수의 사용이 일치하다면 제네릭 타입 매개변수에 다른 이름을 사용할 수도 있습니다.\nfunction identity(arg: T): T {\n    return arg;\n}\n\nlet myIdentity: (arg: U) => U = identity;\n\n제네릭 타입을 객체 리터럴 타입의 호출 형식으로도 사용할 수 있습니다:\nfunction identity(arg: T): T {\n    return arg;\n}\n\nlet myIdentity: {(arg: T): T} = identity;\n\n따라서 첫번째 제네릭 인터페이스를 작성하게 됩니다.\n앞의 예제에서 객체 리터럴을 가져와 인터페이스로 옮깁니다.\ninterface GenericIdentityFn {\n    (arg: T): T;\n}\n\nfunction identity(arg: T): T {\n    return arg;\n}\n\nlet myIdentity: GenericIdentityFn = identity;\n\n비슷한 예에서 제네릭 매개변수를 전체 인터페이스의 매개변수로 이동하려고 할 수 있습니다.\n이렇게하면 일반적으로 사용하는 유형(예: Dictionary 가 아닌 Dictionary) 을 볼 수 있습니다. 이것은 인터페이스의 다른 모든 멤버가 타입 매개변수를 볼 수 있게합니다.\ninterface GenericIdentityFn {\n    (arg: T): T;\n}\n\nfunction identity(arg: T): T {\n    return arg;\n}\n\nlet myIdentity: GenericIdentityFn = identity;\n\n예제를 약간 다른 것으로 바꿔보겠습니다.\n제네릭 함수 대신 제네릭 타입의 일부인 비 제네릭 함수 signature로 설명하겠습니다.\n우리가 GenericIdentityFn 을 사용할 때 대응하는 타입 매개변수(여기서는 number)를 지정할 필요가 있고 호출 형식을 효과적으로 고정시킬 것입니다.\n언제 직접 호출 형식에 타입 파라미터를 삽입해야 하고 언제 인터페이스 자체에 삽입해야하는지를 이해하는 것이 타입의 어떤 측면이 제네릭인지 설명하는데 도움이 될 것입니다.\n제네릭 인터페이스 외에도 제네릭 클래스를 만들 수 있습니다.\n하지만 제네릭 열거형과 네임스페이스는 만들 수 없습니다.\n제네릭 클래스 (Generic Classes)\n제네릭 클래스는 제네릭 인터페이스와 형태가 비슷합니다.\n제네릭 클래스는 클래스 이름 다음에 꺾쇠 괄호(<>)로 묶인 제네릭 타입 매개변수들을 갖습니다.\nclass GenericNumber {\n    zeroValue: T;\n    add: (x: T, y: T) => T;\n}\n\nlet myGenericNumber = new GenericNumber();\nmyGenericNumber.zeroValue = 0;\nmyGenericNumber.add = function(x, y) { return x + y; };\n\n이것은 GenericNumber 문자 그대로 number 타입만 사용하도록 제한하는 것이 없다는 것을 눈치 챘을 것입니다.\n대신 string 이나 더 복잡한 객체를 사용할 수 있을 것입니다.\nlet stringNumeric = new GenericNumber();\nstringNumeric.zeroValue = \"\";\nstringNumeric.add = function(x, y) { return x + y; };\n\nalert(stringNumeric.add(stringNumeric.zeroValue, \"test\"));\n\n인터페이스와 마찬가지로 타입 매개변수를 클래스 자체에 두면 클래스의 모든 속성이 동일한 타입으로 작동하도록 할 수 있습니다.\n클래스 섹션에서 다루었던 것처럼 클래스에는 정적인 측면과 인스턴스 측면의 두가지 측면이 있습니다.\n제네릭 클래스는 정적 측면 보다는 인스턴스 측면에서만 제네릭이므로 클래스를 사용할 때 정적 멤버(static member)는 클래스의 타입 매개변수를 사용할 수 없습니다.\n제네릭 제약조건 (Generic Constraints)\n이전의 예제를 기억한다면 타입들에 어떤 기능이 있는지에 대한 지식이 있는 타입에서 작동하는 제네릭 함수를 작성해야 할 때가 있습니다.\nloggingIdentity 예제에서는 arg의 .length 프로퍼티에 접근하기를 원했지만 컴파일러는 모든 타입이 .length 속성을 가지고 있음을 증명할 수 없었습니다. 그래서 컴파일러는 이러한 가정을 하지 않도록 경고를 줍니다.\nfunction loggingIdentity(arg: T): T {\n    console.log(arg.length);  // 오류 : T는 .length 메소드를 가지고 있지 않습니다.\n    return arg;\n}\n\n모든 타입으로 작업하는 대신 이 함수가 .length 프로퍼티를 가진 모든 타입에서 작동하도록 제한을 두고 싶을 것입니다.\n타입에 이 멤버가 있으면 타입을 허용하지만 적어도 이 멤버가 있어야 합니다.\n그렇게 하기 위해서는 T 가 무엇이 될 수 있는지에 대한 제약으로서 요구 사항을 작성해야 합니다.\n그러기 위해 제약 조건을 설명하는 인터페이스를 만들 것입니다.\n여기에서는 하나의 .length 프로퍼티를 가진 인터페이스를 만들고 이 인터페이스와 extends 키워드를 사용하여 제약조건을 나타냅니다.\ninterface Lengthwise {\n    length: number;\n}\n\nfunction loggingIdentity(arg: T): T {\n    console.log(arg.length);  // 이제 .length 프로퍼티가 있으므로 더이상 오류가 없습니다.\n    return arg;\n}\n\n제네릭 함수는 이제 제한되어 있으므로 더이상 모든 타입에서 작동하지 않습니다.\nloggingIdentity(3);  // 오류, number 는 .length 프로퍼티가 없습니다.\n\n대신 모든 필수 프로퍼티가 있는 타입의 값을 전달해야 합니다.\nloggingIdentity({length: 10, value: 3});\n\n제네릭 제약조건에서 타입 매개변수 사용 (Using Type Parameters in Generic Constraints)\n다른 타입 매개 변수에 의해 제한되는 타입 매개변수를 선언할 수 있습니다.\n예를 들어 여기서는 이름을 가진 객체의 프로퍼티를 가져오려고 합니다.\n실수로 obj에 존재하지 않는 프로퍼티를 잡아내지 않도록 하고자 합니다. 그래서 두가지 타입 사이에 제약조건을 적용할 것입니다:\nfunction getProperty(obj: T, key: K) {\n    return obj[key];\n}\n\nlet x = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 };\n\ngetProperty(x, \"a\"); // 오류 없음\ngetProperty(x, \"m\"); // 오류 : 타입 'm'의 인수를 'a' | 'b' | 'c' | 'd' 에 할당 할 수 없습니다.\n\n제네릭에서 클래스 타입 사용 (Using Class Types in Generics)\n제네릭을 사용하여 TypeSciprt에서 팩토리를 생성할 때 생성자 함수를 사용하여 클래스 타입을 참조해야 합니다. 예를 들어,\nfunction create(c: {new(): T; }): T {\n    return new c();\n}\n\n아래의 고급 예제는 프로토타입 프로퍼티를 사용하여 생성자 함수와 클래스 타입의 인스턴스 사이의 관계를 추론하고 제한합니다.\nclass BeeKeeper {\n    hasMask: boolean;\n}\n\nclass ZooKeeper {\n    nametag: string;\n}\n\nclass Animal {\n    numLegs: number;\n}\n\nclass Bee extends Animal {\n    keeper: BeeKeeper;\n}\n\nclass Lion extends Animal {\n    keeper: ZooKeeper;\n}\n\nfunction createInstance(c: new () => A): A {\n    return new c();\n}\n\ncreateInstance(Lion).keeper.nametag;  // 타입 체크!\ncreateInstance(Bee).keeper.hasMask;   // 타입 체크!\n\n"},"pages/Enums.html":{"url":"pages/Enums.html","title":"열거형","keywords":"","body":"열거형 (Enums)\n열거형을 사용하면 이름이 있는 상수들을 정의할 수 있습니다.\n열거형의 사용은 문서의 의도나 명확한 사례들을 쉽게 만들 수 있습니다.\nTypeScript 는 숫자 및

location: string; } 입니다\nlet y = { name: \"Alice\", location: \"Seattle\" };\nx = y;\n\ny가 x에 할당될 수 있는지를 검사하기 위해 컴파일러는 x의 각 프로퍼티를 검사하여 y에서 상응하는 호환되는 프로퍼티를 찾습니다.\n이 경우 y는 문자열인 name 멤버를 가져야합니다. 그렇기 때문에 할당이 허용됩니다.\n함수 호출 인수를 검사할 때 다음과 같은 할당 규칙이 사용됩니다 :\nfunction greet(n: Named) {\n    alert(\"Hello, \" + n.name);\n}\ngreet(y); // 좋아요\n\ny는 별도의 location 프로퍼티를 가지고 있지만  이로 인해 오류가 생기는 것은 아니라는 점에 유의한다.  \n호환성을 검사할 때 대상의 타입 (이 경우 Named) 멤버만 고려됩니다.\n이 비교 프로세스는 재귀적으로 진행되어 각 구성원 및 하위 멤버의 유형을 탐색합니다.\n두 함수 비교 (Comparing two functions)\n원시적인 타입과 객체 타입을 비교하는 것은 비교적 간단하지만 호환성이 있는 것으로 간주되어야 하는 함수의 종류에 대한 질문은 좀 더 복잡합니다.\n먼저 매개변수 목록에서만 다른 두 함수의 기본 예제를 살펴보겠습니다 :\nlet x = (a: number) => 0;\nlet y = (b: number, s: string) => 0;\n\ny = x; // 좋아요\nx = y; // 오류\n\nx가 y에 할당될 수 있는지 확인하기 위해 우선 매개 변수 목록을 살펴봅니다.\nx의 각 매개 변수는 호환 가능한 타입을 가진 y에서 상응하는 매개 변수를 가져야합니다.\n매개 변수 이름은 고려되지 않으며 타입만 고려됩니다.이 경우x의 모든 매개 변수는y에 상응하는 호환 매개 변수를 가지므로 할당이 허용됩니다.\ny에는 x가 필요로 하지 않는 두 번째 매개 변수가 있어 할당이 허용되지 않으므로 오류입니다.\ny = x 예시와 같은 '버려지는' 매개변수를 허용하는지 이유가 의심스러울겁니다.이 할당이 허용되는 이유는 JavaScript에서 추가적인 함수 매개 변수를 무시하는 것이 상당히 흔한 일이기 때문입니다.  \n예를 들어 Array#forEach는 콜백 함수에 세 개의 매개 변수를 제공합니다 : 배열 요소와 해당 인덱스 및 포함된 배열\n그럼에도 불구하고 첫 번째 매개 변수 만 사용하는 콜백을 제공하는 것은 매우 유용합니다 :\nlet items = [1, 2, 3];\n\n// 이러한 추가 매개 변수를 강제로 사용하지 마세요\nitems.forEach((item, index, array) => console.log(item));\n\n// 괜찮을 거에요!\nitems.forEach(item => console.log(item));\n\n이제 타입 유형에 따라 다른 두 함수를 사용하여 반환 타입을 처리하는 방법을 살펴보겠습니다:\nlet x = () => ({name: \"Alice\"});\nlet y = () => ({name: \"Alice\", location: \"Seattle\"});\n\nx = y; // 좋아요\ny = x; // x에 location 프로퍼티가 없기 때문에 오류\n\n타입 시스템은 소스 함수의 반환 타입이 대상 타입의 반환 타입의 서브 타입이되도록 강제합니다.\n함수 매개변수의 Bivariance (Function Parameter Bivariance)\n함수 매개 변수의 타입을 비교할 때 원본 매개 변수가 대상 매개 변수에 할당 가능하거나 그 반대일 경우 할당이 성공합니다.\n이것은 호출한 측에서 더 특수화된 타입을 취하는 함수를 제공하게 될 수도 있지만 덜 특수화된 타입의 함수를 호출할 수 있기 때문에 바람직하지 않습니다.\n실제로 이런 종류의 오류는 드물기 때문에 이를 통해 많은 일반적인 JavaScript 패턴을 사용할 수 있습니다. \n간단한 예제:\nenum EventType { Mouse, Keyboard }\n\ninterface Event { timestamp: number; }\ninterface MouseEvent extends Event { x: number; y: number }\ninterface KeyEvent extends Event { keyCode: number }\n\nfunction listenEvent(eventType: EventType, handler: (n: Event) => void) {\n    /* ... */\n}\n\n// 부적절하지만 유익하고 일반적인\nlistenEvent(EventType.Mouse, (e: MouseEvent) => console.log(e.x + \",\" + e.y));\n\n// 안정성에서 바람직하지 않은 대안\nlistenEvent(EventType.Mouse, (e: Event) => console.log((e).x + \",\" + (e).y));\nlistenEvent(EventType.Mouse,  void>((e: MouseEvent) => console.log(e.x + \",\" + e.y)));\n\n//그래도 허용되지 않습니다(명확한 오류). 완전히 호환되지 않는 유형에 대해 적용되는 타입 안전성(Type safety)\nlistenEvent(EventType.Mouse, (e: number) => console.log(e));\n\n선택적 매개 변수와 나머지 매개 변수 (Optional Parameters and Rest Parameters)\n호환성을 위한 함수를 비교할 때 선택적 매개 변수와 필수 매개 변수는 서로 바꿔서 사용할 수 있습니다.원본 타입의 추가 선택적 매개 변수는 오류가 아니며 원본 타입의 해당 매개 변수가 없는 대상 타입의 선택적 매개 변수는 오류가 아닙니다.\n함수에 나머지 매개 변수가 있으면 함수가 선택적 매개 변수의 무한적입 집합인것처럼 처리됩니다.\n이는 타입 시스템의 관점에서 보면 중요하지 않지만 런타임 관점에서 선택적 매개 변수의 개념은 일반적으로 잘 적용되지 않습니다.왜냐하면 그 위치에서 undefined가 통과하는 것이 대부분의 함수가 같기 때문입니다.\n동기를 부여하는 예제는 콜백을 수행하고 일부(개발자에게) 예측 가능하지만 (타입 시스템에) 알 수 없는 인수를 사용하여 호출하는 함수의 일반적인 패턴입니다.\nfunction invokeLater(args: any[], callback: (...args: any[]) => void) {\n    /* ... 'arg'로 콜백을 호출합니다. ... */\n}\n\n// 부적절함 - invokeLater 임의의 수의 인수를 제공\"할 수도 있습니다\"\ninvokeLater([1, 2], (x, y) => console.log(x + \", \" + y));\n\n// 혼란스러움 (x와 y는 정말로 필요합니다) 발견 할 수 없습니다.\ninvokeLater([1, 2], (x?, y?) => console.log(x + \", \" + y));\n\n오버로드 함수 (Functions with overloads)\n함수에 오버로드가 있는 경우 원본 타입의 각 오버로드는 대상 타입의 호환가능한 서명과 일치해야합니다.이렇게하면 원본 함수와 동일한 모든 상황에서 대상 함수를 호출 할 수 있습니다.\n열거형 (Enums)\n열거형은 숫자와 호환되며 숫자는 열거형과 호환됩니다.다른 열거형에서 가져온 열거형의 값은 호환되지 않는 것으로 간주됩니다.\n예를 들어\nenum Status { Ready, Waiting };\nenum Color { Red, Blue, Green };\n\nlet status = Status.Ready;\nstatus = Color.Green;  // 오류\n\n클래스 (Classes)\n클래스는 한가지 예외를 제외하고 객체의 리터럴 타입 및 인터페이스와 유사하게 작동합니다: 정적 타입과 인스턴스 타입을 모두 포함합니다.  \n한 클래스 타입의 두 객체를 비교할 때 인스턴스의 멤버만 비교됩니다.정적 멤버 및 생성자는 호환성에 영향을 미치지 않습니다.\nclass Animal {\n    feet: number;\n    constructor(name: string, numFeet: number) { }\n}\n\nclass Size {\n    feet: number;\n    constructor(numFeet: number) { }\n}\n\nlet a: Animal;\nlet s: Size;\n\na = s;  // 좋아요\ns = a;  // 좋아요\n\n클래스의 Private와 protected 멤버 (Private and protected members in classes)\n클래스의 Private와 및 protected 멤버는 호환성에 영향을 줍니다.클래스의 인스턴스가 호환성을 검사할 때 대상 타입에 private 멤버가 포함되어 있으면 원본 타입에 동일한 클래스에서 비롯된 private 멤버가 포함되어 있어야합니다.마찬가지로 protected 멤버가 있는 인스턴스에도 동일하게 적용됩니다.이를 통해 클래스는 수퍼 클래스와 할당을 지정하는 것이 가능하지만 다른 상속 계층 구조의 클래스에서는 동일한 형태을 가질 수 없습니다.\n제네릭 (Generics)\nTypeScript는 구조적인 타입 시스템이기 때문에 타입 매개변수는 멤버 타입의 일부로 사용될 때 결과 타입에 만 영향을 줍니다.\n예를 들어\ninterface Empty {\n}\nlet x: Empty;\nlet y: Empty;\n\nx = y;  // 좋아요, y는 x의 구조와 일치합니다\n\n위의 경우 x와 y의 구조가 인수 타입를 차별화된 방식으로 사용하지 않기 때문에 호환 가능합니다.\nEmpty에 멤버를 추가하여 이 예제를 변경하면 어떻게 동작하는지 보여줍니다 :\ninterface NotEmpty {\n    data: T;\n}\nlet x: NotEmpty;\nlet y: NotEmpty;\n\nx = y;  // 오류, x와 y는 호환되지 않습니다\n\n이런 식으로 인수 타입이 명시된 제네릭 타입은 비-제네릭 타입처럼 동작합니다.\n인수 타입 지정되지 않은 제네릭 타입의 경우 모든 지정되지 않은 인수 타입 대신에 any를 지정하여 호환성을 검사합니다.그런 다음 결과로 나타나는 유형의 호환성을 일반적이지 않은 경우와 마찬가지로 검사합니다.그 결과 생성된 타입은 비-제네릭 경우와 마찬가지로 호환성을 검사합니다.\n예를 들어\nlet identity = function(x: T): T {\n    // ...\n}\n\nlet reverse = function(y: U): U {\n    // ...\n}\n\nidentity = reverse;  // 좋아요 왜냐하면 (x: any)=>any 일치 (y: any)=>any\n\n고급 주제 (Advanced Topics)\n하위 타입 vs 할당 (Subtype vs Assignment)\n지금까지는 언어 사양에 정의된 용어가 아닌 '호환성'을 사용했습니다.TypeScript에는 두 종류의 호환성이 있습니다: 하위 타입과 할당\n이러한 할당과 any에서와 숫자 값을 상응하는 열거형까지 할당을 허용하는 규칙과 하위 호환성을 확장에서만 차이가 있다.\n다른 위치는 상황에 따라 두 가지 호환 메커니즘 중 하나를 사용합니다.실용적인 목적을 위해 타입 호환성은 implements와 extends의 경우에도 할당 호환성에 의해 결정됩니다.\n자세한 내용은 TypeScript 사양을 참조하십시오.\n"},"pages/Advanced Types.html":{"url":"pages/Advanced Types.html","title":"고급 타입","keywords":"","body":"교차 타입 (Intersection Types)\n교차 타입은 다양한 타입을 하나로 결합합니다.따라서 기존 타입을 추가하여 필요한 모든 기능을 갖춘 단일 타입을 얻을 수 있습니다.\n예를 들어 Person & Serializable & Loggable은 Person 과 Serializable 이며 Loggable 입니다.즉 이 타입의 객체는 세 가지 타입의 모든 멤버를 갖게됩니다.\n믹스인에 사용되는 교차 타입과 고전적인 객체 지향 형식에 맞지 않는 다른 개념을 볼 수 있습니다.(JavaScript에 이러한 것들이 많습니다!)\n여기에 Mixin을 만드는 방법을 보여 주는 간단한 예제가 있습니다 :\nfunction extend(first: T, second: U): T & U {\n    let result = {};\n    for (let

라이브러리를 실행하게됩니다.\n예를 들어 다음과 같은 함수을 수행하십시오:\n/**\n * string 타입을 가져와서 왼쪽에 \"padding\"을 추가합니다.\n * 'padding'이 string인 경우에는 'padding'이 왼쪽에 추가됩니다.\n * 'padding'이 number인 경우에는 해당 개수의 공백이 왼쪽에 추가됩니다.\n

       return padding + value;\n    }\n    throw new Error(`Expected string or number, got '${padding}'.`);\n}\n\npadLeft(\"Hello world\", 4); // \"    Hello world\" 반환\n\npadLeft의 문제점은 padding 매개 변수가 any로 분류된다는 것입니다.즉 number이거나 string이 아닌 인수를 사용하여 호출할 수 있지만 TypeScript는 해당 인수와 함께 사용할 수 있습니다.\nlet indentedString = padLeft(\"Hello world\", true); // 컴파일 타임에는 통과되지만 런타임에는 실패합니다.\n\n전통적인 객체 지향 코드에서는 유형의 계층을 만들어 두 가지 유형을 추상화 할 수 있습니다.이것이 훨씬 더 명백하기는 하지만 또 약간 지나치기도 합니다.padLeft의 원래 버전에 대한 좋은 점 중 하나는 원시 값을 전달할 수 있다는 것입니다.이는 사용법이 간단하고 간결하다는 것을 의미했습니다.이 새로운 접근법은 이미 다른 곳에있는 함수를 사용하려는 경우에도 도움이되지 않습니다.\nany 대신 padding 매개변수에 union type 을 사용할 수 있습니다 :\n/**\n * string 타입을 가져와서 왼쪽에 \"padding\"을 추가합니다.\n * 'padding'이 string인 경우에는 'padding'이 왼쪽에 추가됩니다.\n * 'padding'이 number인 경우에는 해당 개수의 공백이 왼쪽에 추가됩니다.\n */\nfunction padLeft(value: string, padding: string | number) {\n    // ...\n}\n\nlet indentedString = padLeft(\"Hello world\", true); // 컴파일 시 오류\n\n유니온 타입은 여러 타입 중 하나일 수 있는 값을 설명합니다.각 타입을 구분하기 위해 수직 막대(|)를 사용하므로 number | string | boolean은 number, string 또는 boolean 될 수 있는 값의 타입입니다.\n유니온 타입이 있는 값이 있으면 유니온의 모든 타입에 공통적인 멤버에만 접근할 수 있습니다.\ninterface Bird {\n    fly();\n    layEggs();\n}\n\ninterface Fish {\n    swim();\n    layEggs();\n}\n\nfunction getSmallPet(): Fish | Bird {\n    // ...\n}\n\nlet pet = getSmallPet();\npet.layEggs(); // 좋아요\npet.swim();    // 오류\n\n유니온 타입이 좀 까다로울 수도 있지만 익숙해지는 데는 약간의 직관이 필요할 뿐입니다.어떤 값에 A | B 타입이 있다면 A 와 B 모두 가지고있는 멤버가 있음을 확실히 알고 있습니다.이 예제에서 Bird는 fly라는 멤버를 가지고 있습니다.하지만 Bird | Fish의 변수 타입이 fly 메서드로 작용하고 있는지는 알 수 없습니다.런타임에 변수가 Fish 인경우 pet.fly() 호출은 실패합니다.\n타입 가드와 차별 타입 (Type Guards and Differentiating Types)\n유니온 타입은 값을 취할 수있는 타입으로 겹칠 수있는 상황을 모델링 할 때 유용합니다.Fish를 가지고 있는지에 대해 구체적으로 알아야 할 필요가 있을 때 무슨 일이 일어날까요?JavaScript에서 두 가지 가능한 값을 구별하는 일반적인 용어는 멤버의 존재를 확인하는 것입니다.\n언급했듯이 유니온 타입의 모든 구성 요소에 포함될 수 있는 보장된 멤버에만 접근할 수 있습니다.\nlet pet = getSmallPet();\n\n// 이러한 각 프로퍼티 접근은 오류를 발생시킵니다.\nif (pet.swim) {\n    pet.swim();\n}\nelse if (pet.fly) {\n    pet.fly();\n}\n\n동일한 코드가 작동하도록하려면 타입 표명을 사용해야합니다 :\nlet pet = getSmallPet();\n\nif ((pet).swim) {\n    (pet).swim();\n}\nelse {\n    (pet).fly();\n}\n\nUser-Defined Type Guards\nNotice that we had to use type assertions several times.\nIt would be much better if once we performed the check, we could know the type of pet within each branch.\nIt just so happens that TypeScript has something called a type guard.\nA type guard is some expression that performs a runtime check that guarantees the type in some scope.\nTo define a type guard, we simply need to define a function whose return type is a type predicate:\nfunction isFish(pet: Fish | Bird): pet is Fish {\n    return (pet).swim !== undefined;\n}\n\npet is Fish is our type predicate in this example.\nA predicate takes the form parameterName is Type, where parameterName must be the name of a parameter from the current function signature.\nAny time isFish is called with some variable, TypeScript will narrow that variable to that specific type if the original type is compatible.\n// Both calls to 'swim' and 'fly' are now okay.\n\nif (isFish(pet)) {\n    pet.swim();\n}\nelse {\n    pet.fly();\n}\n\nNotice that TypeScript not only knows that pet is a Fish in the if branch;\nit also knows that in the else branch, you don't have a Fish, so you must have a Bird.\ntypeof type guards\nLet's go back and write the code for the version of padLeft that uses union types.\nWe could write it with type predicates as follows:\nfunction isNumber(x: any): x is number {\n    return typeof x === \"number\";\n}\n\nfunction isString(x: any): x is string {\n    return typeof x === \"string\";\n}\n\nfunction padLeft(value: string, padding: string | number) {\n    if (isNumber(padding)) {\n        return Array(padding + 1).join(\" \") + value;\n    }\n    if (isString(padding)) {\n        return padding + value;\n    }\n    throw new Error(`Expected string or number, got '${padding}'.`);\n}\n\nHowever, having to define a function to figure out if a type is a primitive is kind of a pain.\nLuckily, you don't need to abstract typeof x === \"number\" into its own function because TypeScript will recognize it as a type guard on its own.\nThat means we could just write these checks inline.\nfunction padLeft(value: string, padding: string | number) {\n    if (typeof padding === \"number\") {\n        return Array(padding + 1).join(\" \") + value;\n    }\n    if (typeof padding === \"string\") {\n        return padding + value;\n    }\n    throw new Error(`Expected string or number, got '${padding}'.`);\n}\n\nThese typeof type guards are recognized in two different forms: typeof v === \"typename\" and typeof v !== \"typename\", where \"typename\" must be \"number\", \"string\", \"boolean\", or \"symbol\".\nWhile TypeScript won't stop you from comparing to other strings, the language won't recognize those expressions as type guards.\ninstanceof type guards\nIf you've read about typeof type guards and are familiar with the instanceof operator in JavaScript, you probably have some idea of what this section is about.\ninstanceof type guards are a way of narrowing types using their constructor function.\nFor instance, let's borrow our industrial string-padder example from earlier:\ninterface Padder {\n    getPaddingString(): string\n}\n\nclass SpaceRepeatingPadder implements Padder {\n    constructor(private numSpaces: number) { }\n    getPaddingString() {\n        return Array(this.numSpaces + 1).join(\" \");\n    }\n}\n\nclass StringPadder implements Padder {\n    constructor(private value: string) { }\n    getPaddingString() {\n        return this.value;\n    }\n}\n\nfunction getRandomPadder() {\n    return Math.random() \nThe right side of the instanceof needs to be a constructor function, and TypeScript will narrow down to:\n\nthe type of the function's prototype property if its type is not any\nthe union of types returned by that type's construct signatures\n\nin that order.\nNullable types\nTypeScript has two special types, null and undefined, that have the values null and undefined respectively.\nWe mentioned these briefly in the Basic Types section.\nBy default, the type checker considers null and undefined assignable to anything.\nEffectively, null and undefined are valid values of every type.\nThat means it's not possible to stop them from being assigned to any type, even when you would like to prevent it.\nThe inventor of null, Tony Hoare, calls this his \"billion dollar mistake\".\nThe --strictNullChecks flag fixes this: when you declare a variable, it doesn't automatically include null or undefined.\nYou can include them explicitly using a union type:\nlet s = \"foo\";\ns = null; // error, 'null' is not assignable to 'string'\nlet sn: string | null = \"bar\";\nsn = null; // ok\n\nsn = undefined; // error, 'undefined' is not assignable to 'string | null'\n\nNote that TypeScript treats null and undefined differently in order to match JavaScript semantics.\nstring | null is a different type than string | undefined and string | undefined | null.\nOptional parameters and properties\nWith --strictNullChecks, an optional parameter automatically adds | undefined:\nfunction f(x: number, y?: number) {\n    return x + (y || 0);\n}\nf(1, 2);\nf(1);\nf(1, undefined);\nf(1, null); // error, 'null' is not assignable to 'number | undefined'\n\nThe same is true for optional properties:\nclass C {\n    a: number;\n    b?: number;\n}\nlet c = new C();\nc.a = 12;\nc.a = undefined; // error, 'undefined' is not assignable to 'number'\nc.b = 13;\nc.b = undefined; // ok\nc.b = null; // error, 'null' is not assignable to 'number | undefined'\n\nType guards and type assertions\nSince nullable types are implemented with a union, you need to use a type guard to get rid of the null.\nFortunately, this is the same code you'd write in JavaScript:\nfunction f(sn: string | null): string {\n    if (sn == null) {\n        return \"default\";\n    }\n    else {\n        return sn;\n    }\n}\n\nThe null elimination is pretty obvious here, but you can use terser operators too:\nfunction f(sn: string | null): string {\n    return sn || \"default\";\n}\n\nIn cases where the compiler can't eliminate null or undefined, you can use the type assertion operator to manually remove them.\nThe syntax is postfix !: identifier! removes null and undefined from the type of identifier:\nfunction broken(name: string | null): string {\n  function postfix(epithet: string) {\n    return name.charAt(0) + '.  the ' + epithet; // error, 'name' is possibly null\n  }\n  name = name || \"Bob\";\n  return postfix(\"great\");\n}\n\nfunction fixed(name: string | null): string {\n  function postfix(epithet: string) {\n    return name!.charAt(0) + '.  the ' + epithet; // ok\n  }\n  name = name || \"Bob\";\n  return postfix(\"great\");\n}\n\nThe example uses a nested function here because the compiler can't eliminate nulls inside a nested function (except immediately-invoked function expressions).\nThat's because it can't track all calls to the nested function, especially if you return it from the outer function.\nWithout knowing where the function is called, it can't know what the type of name will be at the time the body executes.\nType Aliases\nType aliases create a new name for a type.\nType aliases are sometimes similar to interfaces, but can name primitives, unions, tuples, and any other types that you'd otherwise have to write by hand.\ntype Name = string;\ntype NameResolver = () => string;\ntype NameOrResolver = Name | NameResolver;\nfunction getName(n: NameOrResolver): Name {\n    if (typeof n === \"string\") {\n        return n;\n    }\n    else {\n        return n();\n    }\n}\n\nAliasing doesn't actually create a new type - it creates a new name to refer to that type.\nAliasing a primitive is not terribly useful, though it can be used as a form of documentation.\nJust like interfaces, type aliases can also be generic - we can just add type parameters and use them on the right side of the alias declaration:\ntype Container = { value: T };\n\nWe can also have a type alias refer to itself in a property:\ntype Tree = {\n    value: T;\n    left: Tree;\n    right: Tree;\n}\n\nTogether with intersection types, we can make some pretty mind-bending types:\ntype LinkedList = T & { next: LinkedList };\n\ninterface Person {\n    name: string;\n}\n\nvar people: LinkedList;\nvar s = people.name;\nvar s = people.next.name;\nvar s = people.next.next.name;\nvar s = people.next.next.next.name;\n\nHowever, it's not possible for a type alias to appear anywhere else on the right side of the declaration:\ntype Yikes = Array; // error\n\nInterfaces vs. Type Aliases\nAs we mentioned, type aliases can act sort of like interfaces; however, there are some subtle differences.\nOne difference is that interfaces create a new name that is used everywhere.\nType aliases don't create a new name — for instance, error messages won't use the alias name.\nIn the code below, hovering over interfaced in an editor will show that it returns an Interface, but will show that aliased returns object literal type.\ntype Alias = { num: number }\ninterface Interface {\n    num: number;\n}\ndeclare function aliased(arg: Alias): Alias;\ndeclare function interfaced(arg: Interface): Interface;\n\nA second more important difference is that type aliases cannot be extended or implemented from (nor can they extend/implement other types).\nBecause an ideal property of software is being open to extension, you should always use an interface over a type alias if possible.\nOn the other hand, if you can't express some shape with an interface and you need to use a union or tuple type, type aliases are usually the way to go.\nString Literal Types\nString literal types allow you to specify the exact value a string must have.\nIn practice string literal types combine nicely with union types, type guards, and type aliases.\nYou can use these features together to get enum-like behavior with strings.\ntype Easing = \"ease-in\" | \"ease-out\" | \"ease-in-out\";\nclass UIElement {\n    animate(dx: number, dy: number, easing: Easing) {\n        if (easing === \"ease-in\") {\n            // ...\n        }\n        else if (easing === \"ease-out\") {\n        }\n        else if (easing === \"ease-in-out\") {\n        }\n        else {\n            // error! should not pass null or undefined.\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nlet button = new UIElement();\nbutton.animate(0, 0, \"ease-in\");\nbutton.animate(0, 0, \"uneasy\"); // error: \"uneasy\" is not allowed here\n\nYou can pass any of the three allowed strings, but any other string will give the error\nArgument of type '\"uneasy\"' is not assignable to parameter of type '\"ease-in\" | \"ease-out\" | \"ease-in-out\"'\n\nString literal types can be used in the same way to distinguish overloads:\nfunction createElement(tagName: \"img\"): HTMLImageElement;\nfunction createElement(tagName: \"input\"): HTMLInputElement;\n// ... more overloads ...\nfunction createElement(tagName: string): Element {\n    // ... code goes here ...\n}\n\nNumeric Literal Types\nTypeScript also has numeric literal types.\nfunction rollDie(): 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 {\n    // ...\n}\n\nThese are seldom written explicitly, they can be useful when narrowing can catch bugs:\nfunction foo(x: number) {\n    if (x !== 1 || x !== 2) {\n        //         ~~~~~~~\n        // Operator '!==' cannot be applied to types '1' and '2'.\n    }\n}\n\nIn other words, x must be 1 when it gets compared to 2, meaning that the above check is making an invalid comparison.\nEnum Member Types\nAs mentioned in our section on enums, enum members have types when every member is literal-initialized.\nMuch of the time when we talk about \"singleton types\", we're referring to both enum member types as well as numeric/string literal types, though many users will use \"singleton types\" and \"literal types\" interchangeably.\nDiscriminated Unions\nYou can combine singleton types, union types, type guards, and type aliases to build an advanced pattern called discriminated unions, also known as tagged unions or algebraic data types.\nDiscriminated unions are useful in functional programming.\nSome languages automatically discriminate unions for you; TypeScript instead builds on JavaScript patterns as they exist today.\nThere are three ingredients:\n\nTypes that have a common, singleton type property — the discriminant.\nA type alias that takes the union of those types — the union.\nType guards on the common property.\n\ninterface Square {\n    kind: \"square\";\n    size: number;\n}\ninterface Rectangle {\n    kind: \"rectangle\";\n    width: number;\n    height: number;\n}\ninterface Circle {\n    kind: \"circle\";\n    radius: number;\n}\n\nFirst we declare the interfaces we will union.\nEach interface has a kind property with a different string literal type.\nThe kind property is called the discriminant or tag.\nThe other properties are specific to each interface.\nNotice that the interfaces are currently unrelated.\nLet's put them into a union:\ntype Shape = Square | Rectangle | Circle;\n\nNow let's use the discriminated union:\nfunction area(s: Shape) {\n    switch (s.kind) {\n        case \"square\": return s.size * s.size;\n        case \"rectangle\": return s.height * s.width;\n        case \"circle\": return Math.PI * s.radius ** 2;\n    }\n}\n\nExhaustiveness checking\nWe would like the compiler to tell us when we don't cover all variants of the discriminated union.\nFor example, if we add Triangle to Shape, we need to update area as well:\ntype Shape = Square | Rectangle | Circle | Triangle;\nfunction area(s: Shape) {\n    switch (s.kind) {\n        case \"square\": return s.size * s.size;\n        case \"rectangle\": return s.height * s.width;\n        case \"circle\": return Math.PI * s.radius ** 2;\n    }\n    // should error here - we didn't handle case \"triangle\"\n}\n\nThere are two ways to do this.\nThe first is to turn on --strictNullChecks and specify a return type:\nfunction area(s: Shape): number { // error: returns number | undefined\n    switch (s.kind) {\n        case \"square\": return s.size * s.size;\n        case \"rectangle\": return s.height * s.width;\n        case \"circle\": return Math.PI * s.radius ** 2;\n    }\n}\n\nBecause the switch is no longer exhaustive, TypeScript is aware that the function could sometimes return undefined.\nIf you have an explicit return type number, then you will get an error that the return type is actually number | undefined.\nHowever, this method is quite subtle and, besides, --strictNullChecks does not always work with old code.\nThe second method uses the never type that the compiler uses to check for exhaustiveness:\nfunction assertNever(x: never): never {\n    throw new Error(\"Unexpected object: \" + x);\n}\nfunction area(s: Shape) {\n    switch (s.kind) {\n        case \"square\": return s.size * s.size;\n        case \"rectangle\": return s.height * s.width;\n        case \"circle\": return Math.PI * s.radius ** 2;\n        default: return assertNever(s); // error here if there are missing cases\n    }\n}\n\nHere, assertNever checks that s is of type never — the type that's left after all other cases have been removed.\nIf you forget a case, then s will have a real type and you will get a type error.\nThis method requires you to define an extra function, but it's much more obvious when you forget it.\nPolymorphic this types\nA polymorphic this type represents a type that is the subtype of the containing class or interface.\nThis is called F-bounded polymorphism.\nThis makes hierarchical fluent interfaces much easier to express, for example.\nTake a simple calculator that returns this after each operation:\nclass BasicCalculator {\n    public constructor(protected value: number = 0) { }\n    public currentValue(): number {\n        return this.value;\n    }\n    public add(operand: number): this {\n        this.value += operand;\n        return this;\n    }\n    public multiply(operand: number): this {\n        this.value *= operand;\n        return this;\n    }\n    // ... other operations go here ...\n}\n\nlet v = new BasicCalculator(2)\n            .multiply(5)\n            .add(1)\n            .currentValue();\n\nSince the class uses this types, you can extend it and the new class can use the old methods with no changes.\nclass ScientificCalculator extends BasicCalculator {\n    public constructor(value = 0) {\n        super(value);\n    }\n    public sin() {\n        this.value = Math.sin(this.value);\n        return this;\n    }\n    // ... other operations go here ...\n}\n\nlet v = new ScientificCalculator(2)\n        .multiply(5)\n        .sin()\n        .add(1)\n        .currentValue();\n\nWithout this types, ScientificCalculator would not have been able to extend BasicCalculator and keep the fluent interface.\nmultiply would have returned BasicCalculator, which doesn't have the sin method.\nHowever, with this types, multiply returns this, which is ScientificCalculator here.\nIndex types\nWith index types, you can get the compiler to check code that uses dynamic property names.\nFor example, a common Javascript pattern is to pick a subset of properties from an object:\nfunction pluck(o, names) {\n    return names.map(n => o[n]);\n}\n\nHere's how you would write and use this function in TypeScript, using the index type query and indexed access operators:\nfunction pluck(o: T, names: K[]): T[K][] {\n  return names.map(n => o[n]);\n}\n\ninterface Person {\n    name: string;\n    age: number;\n}\nlet person: Person = {\n    name: 'Jarid',\n    age: 35\n};\nlet strings: string[] = pluck(person, ['name']); // ok, string[]\n\nThe compiler checks that name is actually a property on Person.\nThe example introduces a couple of new type operators.\nFirst is keyof T, the index type query operator.\nFor any type T, keyof T is the union of known, public property names of T.\nFor example:\nlet personProps: keyof Person; // 'name' | 'age'\n\nkeyof Person is completely interchangeable with 'name' | 'age'.\nThe difference is that if you add another property to Person, say address: string, then keyof Person will automatically update to be 'name' | 'age' | 'address'.\nAnd you can use keyof in generic contexts like pluck, where you can't possibly know the property names ahead of time.\nThat means the compiler will check that you pass the right set of property names to pluck:\npluck(person, ['age', 'unknown']); // error, 'unknown' is not in 'name' | 'age'\n\nThe second operator is T[K], the indexed access operator.\nHere, the type syntax reflects the expression syntax.\nThat means that person['name'] has the type Person['name'] — which in our example is just string.\nHowever, just like index type queries, you can use T[K] in a generic context, which is where its real power comes to life.\nYou just have to make sure that the type variable K extends keyof T.\nHere's another example with a function named getProperty.\nfunction getProperty(o: T, name: K): T[K] {\n    return o[name]; // o[name] is of type T[K]\n}\n\nIn getProperty, o: T and name: K, so that means o[name]: T[K].\nOnce you return the T[K] result, the compiler will instantiate the actual type of the key, so the return type of getProperty will vary according to which property you request.\nlet name: string = getProperty(person, 'name');\nlet age: number = getProperty(person, 'age');\nlet unknown = getProperty(person, 'unknown'); // error, 'unknown' is not in 'name' | 'age'\n\nIndex types and string index signatures\nkeyof and T[K] interact with string index signatures.\nIf you have a type with a string index signature, keyof T will just be string.\nAnd T[string] is just the type of the index signature:\ninterface Map {\n    [key: string]: T;\n}\nlet keys: keyof Map; // string\nlet value: Map['foo']; // number\n\nMapped types\nA common task is to take an existing type and make each of its properties optional:\ninterface PersonPartial {\n    name?: string;\n    age?: number;\n}\n\nOr we might want a readonly version:\ninterface PersonReadonly {\n    readonly name: string;\n    readonly age: number;\n}\n\nThis happens often enough in Javascript that TypeScript provides a way to create new types based on old types — mapped types.\nIn a mapped type, the new type transforms each property in the old type in the same way.\nFor example, you can make all properties of a type readonly or optional.\nHere are a couple of examples:\ntype Readonly = {\n    readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P];\n}\ntype Partial = {\n    [P in keyof T]?: T[P];\n}\n\nAnd to use it:\ntype PersonPartial = Partial;\ntype ReadonlyPerson = Readonly;\n\nLet's take a look at the simplest mapped type and its parts:\ntype Keys = 'option1' | 'option2';\ntype Flags = { [K in Keys]: boolean };\n\nThe syntax resembles the syntax for index signatures with a for .. in inside.\nThere are three parts:\n\nThe type variable K, which gets bound to each property in turn.\nThe string literal union Keys, which contains the names of properties to iterate over.\nThe resulting type of the property.\n\nIn this simple example, Keys is a hard-coded list of property names and the property type is always boolean, so this mapped type is equivalent to writing:\ntype Flags = {\n    option1: boolean;\n    option2: boolean;\n}\n\nReal applications, however, look like Readonly or Partial above.\nThey're based on some existing type, and they transform the fields in some way.\nThat's where keyof and indexed access types come in:\ntype NullablePerson = { [P in keyof Person]: Person[P] | null }\ntype PartialPerson = { [P in keyof Person]?: Person[P] }\n\nBut it's more useful to have a general version.\ntype Nullable = { [P in keyof T]: T[P] | null }\ntype Partial = { [P in keyof T]?: T[P] }\n\nIn these examples, the properties list is keyof T and the resulting type is some variant of T[P].\nThis is a good template for any general use of mapped types.\nThat's because this kind of transformation is homomorphic, which means that the mapping applies only to properties of T and no others.\nThe compiler knows that it can copy all the existing property modifiers before adding any new ones.\nFor example, if Person.name was readonly, Partial.name would be readonly and optional.\nHere's one more example, in which T[P] is wrapped in a Proxy class:\ntype Proxy = {\n    get(): T;\n    set(value: T): void;\n}\ntype Proxify = {\n    [P in keyof T]: Proxy;\n}\nfunction proxify(o: T): Proxify {\n   // ... wrap proxies ...\n}\nlet proxyProps = proxify(props);\n\nNote that Readonly and Partial are so useful, they are included in TypeScript's standard library along with Pick and Record:\ntype Pick = {\n    [P in K]: T[P];\n}\ntype Record = {\n    [P in K]: T;\n}\n\nReadonly, Partial and Pick are homomorphic whereas Record is not.\nOne clue that Record is not homomorphic is that it doesn't take an input type to copy properties from:\ntype ThreeStringProps = Record\n\nNon-homomorphic types are essentially creating new properties, so they can't copy property modifiers from anywhere.\nInference from mapped types\nNow that you know how to wrap the properties of a type, the next thing you'll want to do is unwrap them.\nFortunately, that's pretty easy:\nfunction unproxify(t: Proxify): T {\n    let result = {} as T;\n    for (const k in t) {\n        result[k] = t[k].get();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\nlet originalProps = unproxify(proxyProps);\n\nNote that this unwrapping inference only works on homomorphic mapped types.\nIf the mapped type is not homomorphic you'll have to give an explicit type parameter to your unwrapping function.\n"},"pages/Symbols.html":{"url":"pages/Symbols.html","title":"심볼","keywords":"","body":"소개 (Introduction)\nECMAScript 2015에서 시작된 symbol은

TypeScript shares this concept.\nModules are executed within their own scope, not in the global scope; this means that variables, functions, classes, etc. declared in a module are not visible outside the module unless they are explicitly exported using one of the export forms.\nConversely, to consume a variable, function, class, interface, etc. exported from a different module, it has to be imported using one of the import forms.\nModules are declarative; the relationships between modules are specified in terms of imports and exports at the file level.\nModules import one another using a module loader.\nAt runtime the module loader is responsible for locating and executing all dependencies of a module before executing it.\nWell-known modules loaders used in JavaScript are the CommonJS module loader for Node.js and require.js for Web applications.\nIn TypeScript, just as in ECMAScript 2015, any file containing a top-level import or export is considered a module.\nExport\nExporting a declaration\nAny declaration (such as a variable, function, class, type alias, or interface) can be exported by adding the export keyword.\nValidation.ts\nexport interface StringValidator {\n    isAcceptable(s: string): boolean;\n}\n\nZipCodeValidator.ts\nexport const numberRegexp = /^[0-9]+$/;\n\nexport class ZipCodeValidator implements StringValidator {\n    isAcceptable(s: string) {\n        return s.length === 5 && numberRegexp.test(s);\n    }\n}\n\nExport statements\nExport statements are handy when exports need to be renamed for consumers, so the above example can be written as:\nclass ZipCodeValidator implements StringValidator {\n    isAcceptable(s: string) {\n        return s.length === 5 && numberRegexp.test(s);\n    }\n}\nexport { ZipCodeValidator };\nexport { ZipCodeValidator as mainValidator };\n\nRe-exports\nOften modules extend other modules, and partially expose some of their features.\nA re-export does not import it locally, or introduce a local variable.\nParseIntBasedZipCodeValidator.ts\nexport class ParseIntBasedZipCodeValidator {\n    isAcceptable(s: string) {\n        return s.length === 5 && parseInt(s).toString() === s;\n    }\n}\n\n// Export original validator but rename it\nexport {ZipCodeValidator as RegExpBasedZipCodeValidator} from \"./ZipCodeValidator\";\n\nOptionally, a module can wrap one or more modules and combine all their exports using export * from \"module\" syntax.\nAllValidators.ts\nexport * from \"./StringValidator\"; // exports interface 'StringValidator'\nexport * from \"./LettersOnlyValidator\"; // exports class 'LettersOnlyValidator'\nexport * from \"./ZipCodeValidator\";  // exports class 'ZipCodeValidator'\n\nImport\nImporting is just about as easy as exporting from a module.\nImporting an exported declaration is done through using one of the import forms below:\nImport a single export from a module\nimport { ZipCodeValidator } from \"./ZipCodeValidator\";\n\nlet myValidator = new ZipCodeValidator();\n\nimports can also be renamed\nimport { ZipCodeValidator as ZCV } from \"./ZipCodeValidator\";\nlet myValidator = new ZCV();\n\nImport the entire module into a single variable, and use it to access the module exports\nimport * as validator from \"./ZipCodeValidator\";\nlet myValidator = new validator.ZipCodeValidator();\n\nImport a module for side-effects only\nThough not recommended practice, some modules set up some global state that can be used by other modules.\nThese modules may not have any exports, or the consumer is not interested in any of their exports.\nTo import these modules, use:\nimport \"./my-module.js\";\n\nDefault exports\nEach module can optionally export a default export.\nDefault exports are marked with the keyword default; and there can only be one default export per module.\ndefault exports are imported using a different import form.\ndefault exports are really handy.\nFor instance, a library like JQuery might have a default export of jQuery or $, which we'd probably also import under the name $ or jQuery.\nJQuery.d.ts\ndeclare let $: JQuery;\nexport default $;\n\nApp.ts\nimport $ from \"JQuery\";\n\n$(\"button.continue\").html( \"Next Step...\" );\n\nClasses and function declarations can be authored directly as default exports.\nDefault export class and function declaration names are optional.\nZipCodeValidator.ts\nexport default class ZipCodeValidator {\n    static numberRegexp = /^[0-9]+$/;\n    isAcceptable(s: string) {\n        return s.length === 5 && ZipCodeValidator.numberRegexp.test(s);\n    }\n}\n\nTest.ts\nimport validator from \"./ZipCodeValidator\";\n\nlet myValidator = new validator();\n\nor\nStaticZipCodeValidator.ts\nconst numberRegexp = /^[0-9]+$/;\n\nexport default function (s: string) {\n    return s.length === 5 && numberRegexp.test(s);\n}\n\nTest.ts\nimport validate from \"./StaticZipCodeValidator\";\n\nlet strings = [\"Hello\", \"98052\", \"101\"];\n\n// Use function validate\nstrings.forEach(s => {\n  console.log(`\"${s}\" ${validate(s) ? \" matches\" : \" does not match\"}`);\n});\n\ndefault exports can also be just values:\nOneTwoThree.ts\nexport default \"123\";\n\nLog.ts\nimport num from \"./OneTwoThree\";\n\nconsole.log(num); // \"123\"\n\nexport = and import = require()\nBoth CommonJS and AMD generally have the concept of an exports object which contains all exports from a module.\nThey also support replacing the exports object with a custom single object.\nDefault exports are meant to act as a replacement for this behavior; however, the two are incompatible.\nTypeScript supports export = to model the traditional CommonJS and AMD workflow.\nThe export = syntax specifies a single object that is exported from the module.\nThis can be a class, interface, namespace, function, or enum.\nWhen importing a module using export =, TypeScript-specific import module = require(\"module\") must be used to import the module.\nZipCodeValidator.ts\nlet numberRegexp = /^[0-9]+$/;\nclass ZipCodeValidator {\n    isAcceptable(s: string) {\n        return s.length === 5 && numberRegexp.test(s);\n    }\n}\nexport = ZipCodeValidator;\n\nTest.ts\nimport zip = require(\"./ZipCodeValidator\");\n\n// Some samples to try\nlet strings = [\"Hello\", \"98052\", \"101\"];\n\n// Validators to use\nlet validator = new zip();\n\n// Show whether each string passed each validator\nstrings.forEach(s => {\n  console.log(`\"${ s }\" - ${ validator.isAcceptable(s) ? \"matches\" : \"does not match\" }`);\n});\n\nCode Generation for Modules\nDepending on the module target specified during compilation, the compiler will generate appropriate code for Node.js (CommonJS), require.js (AMD), UMD, SystemJS, or ECMAScript 2015 native modules (ES6) module-loading systems.\nFor more information on what the define, require and register calls in the generated code do, consult the documentation for each module loader.\nThis simple example shows how the names used during importing and exporting get translated into the module loading code.\nSimpleModule.ts\nimport m = require(\"mod\");\nexport let t = m.something + 1;\n\nAMD / RequireJS SimpleModule.js\ndefine([\"require\", \"exports\", \"./mod\"], function (require, exports, mod_1) {\n    exports.t = mod_1.something + 1;\n});\n\nCommonJS / Node SimpleModule.js\nvar mod_1 = require(\"./mod\");\nexports.t = mod_1.something + 1;\n\nUMD SimpleModule.js\n(function (factory) {\n    if (typeof module === \"object\" && typeof module.exports === \"object\") {\n        var v = factory(require, exports); if (v !== undefined) module.exports = v;\n    }\n    else if (typeof define === \"function\" && define.amd) {\n        define([\"require\", \"exports\", \"./mod\"], factory);\n    }\n})(function (require, exports) {\n    var mod_1 = require(\"./mod\");\n    exports.t = mod_1.something + 1;\n});\n\nSystem SimpleModule.js\nSystem.register([\"./mod\"], function(exports_1) {\n    var mod_1;\n    var t;\n    return {\n        setters:[\n            function (mod_1_1) {\n                mod_1 = mod_1_1;\n            }],\n        execute: function() {\n            exports_1(\"t\", t = mod_1.something + 1);\n        }\n    }\n});\n\nNative ECMAScript 2015 modules SimpleModule.js\nimport { something } from \"./mod\";\nexport var t = something + 1;\n\nSimple Example\nBelow, we've consolidated the Validator implementations used in previous examples to only export a single named export from each module.\nTo compile, we must specify a module target on the command line. For Node.js, use --module commonjs;\nfor require.js, use --module amd. For example:\ntsc --module commonjs Test.ts\n\nWhen compiled, each module will become a separate .js file.\nAs with reference tags, the compiler will follow import statements to compile dependent files.\nValidation.ts\nexport interface StringValidator {\n    isAcceptable(s: string): boolean;\n}\n\nLettersOnlyValidator.ts\nimport { StringValidator } from \"./Validation\";\n\nconst lettersRegexp = /^[A-Za-z]+$/;\n\nexport class LettersOnlyValidator implements StringValidator {\n    isAcceptable(s: string) {\n        return lettersRegexp.test(s);\n    }\n}\n\nZipCodeValidator.ts\nimport { StringValidator } from \"./Validation\";\n\nconst numberRegexp = /^[0-9]+$/;\n\nexport class ZipCodeValidator implements StringValidator {\n    isAcceptable(s: string) {\n        return s.length === 5 && numberRegexp.test(s);\n    }\n}\n\nTest.ts\nimport { StringValidator } from \"./Validation\";\nimport { ZipCodeValidator } from \"./ZipCodeValidator\";\nimport { LettersOnlyValidator } from \"./LettersOnlyValidator\";\n\n// Some samples to try\nlet strings = [\"Hello\", \"98052\", \"101\"];\n\n// Validators to use\nlet validators: { [s: string]: StringValidator; } = {};\nvalidators[\"ZIP code\"] = new ZipCodeValidator();\nvalidators[\"Letters only\"] = new LettersOnlyValidator();\n\n// Show whether each string passed each validator\nstrings.forEach(s => {\n    for (let name in validators) {\n        console.log(`\"${ s }\" - ${ validators[name].isAcceptable(s) ? \"matches\" : \"does not match\" } ${ name }`);\n    }\n});\n\nOptional Module Loading and Other Advanced Loading Scenarios\nIn some cases, you may want to only load a module under some conditions.\nIn TypeScript, we can use the pattern shown below to implement this and other advanced loading scenarios to directly invoke the module loaders without losing type safety.\nThe compiler detects whether each module is used in the emitted JavaScript.\nIf a module identifier is only ever used as part of a type annotations and never as an expression, then no require call is emitted for that module.\nThis elision of unused references is a good performance optimization, and also allows for optional loading of those modules.\nThe core idea of the pattern is that the import id = require(\"...\") statement gives us access to the types exposed by the module.\nThe module loader is invoked (through require) dynamically, as shown in the if blocks below.\nThis leverages the reference-elision optimization so that the module is only loaded when needed.\nFor this pattern to work, it's important that the symbol defined via an import is only used in type positions (i.e. never in a position that would be emitted into the JavaScript).\nTo maintain type safety, we can use the typeof keyword.\nThe typeof keyword, when used in a type position, produces the type of a value, in this case the type of the module.\nDynamic Module Loading in Node.js\ndeclare function require(moduleName: string): any;\n\nimport { ZipCodeValidator as Zip } from \"./ZipCodeValidator\";\n\nif (needZipValidation) {\n    let ZipCodeValidator: typeof Zip = require(\"./ZipCodeValidator\");\n    let validator = new ZipCodeValidator();\n    if (validator.isAcceptable(\"...\")) { /* ... */ }\n}\n\nSample: Dynamic Module Loading in require.js\ndeclare function require(moduleNames: string[], onLoad: (...args: any[]) => void): void;\n\nimport * as Zip from \"./ZipCodeValidator\";\n\nif (needZipValidation) {\n    require([\"./ZipCodeValidator\"], (ZipCodeValidator: typeof Zip) => {\n        let validator = new ZipCodeValidator.ZipCodeValidator();\n        if (validator.isAcceptable(\"...\")) { /* ... */ }\n    });\n}\n\nSample: Dynamic Module Loading in System.js\ndeclare const System: any;\n\nimport { ZipCodeValidator as Zip } from \"./ZipCodeValidator\";\n\nif (needZipValidation) {\n    System.import(\"./ZipCodeValidator\").then((ZipCodeValidator: typeof Zip) => {\n        var x = new ZipCodeValidator();\n        if (x.isAcceptable(\"...\")) { /* ... */ }\n    });\n}\n\nWorking with Other JavaScript Libraries\nTo describe the shape of libraries not written in TypeScript, we need to declare the API that the library exposes.\nWe call declarations that don't define an implementation \"ambient\".\nTypically, these are defined in .d.ts files.\nIf you're familiar with C/C++, you can think of these as .h files.\nLet's look at a few examples.\nAmbient Modules\nIn Node.js, most tasks are accomplished by loading one or more modules.\nWe could define each module in its own .d.ts file with top-level export declarations, but it's more convenient to write them as one larger .d.ts file.\nTo do so, we use a construct similar to ambient namespaces, but we use the module keyword and the quoted name of the module which will be available to a later import.\nFor example:\nnode.d.ts (simplified excerpt)\ndeclare module \"url\" {\n    export interface Url {\n        protocol?: string;\n        hostname?: string;\n        pathname?: string;\n    }\n\n    export function parse(urlStr: string, parseQueryString?, slashesDenoteHost?): Url;\n}\n\ndeclare module \"path\" {\n    export function normalize(p: string): string;\n    export function join(...paths: any[]): string;\n    export var sep: string;\n}\n\nNow we can ///  node.d.ts and then load the modules using import url = require(\"url\"); or import * as URL from \"url\".\n/// \nimport * as URL from \"url\";\nlet myUrl = URL.parse(\"http://www.typescriptlang.org\");\n\nShorthand ambient modules\nIf you don't want to take the time to write out declarations before using a new module, you can use a shorthand declaration to get started quickly.\ndeclarations.d.ts\ndeclare module \"hot-new-module\";\n\nAll imports from a shorthand module will have the any type.\nimport x, {y} from \"hot-new-module\";\nx(y);\n\nWildcard module declarations\nSome module loaders such as SystemJS\nand AMD allow non-JavaScript content to be imported.\nThese typically use a prefix or suffix to indicate the special loading semantics.\nWildcard module declarations can be used to cover these cases.\ndeclare module \"*!text\" {\n    const content: string;\n    export default content;\n}\n// Some do it the other way around.\ndeclare module \"json!*\" {\n    const value: any;\n    export default value;\n}\n\nNow you can import things that match \"*!text\" or \"json!*\".\nimport fileContent from \"./xyz.txt!text\";\nimport data from \"json!http://example.com/data.json\";\nconsole.log(data, fileContent);\n\nUMD modules\nSome libraries are designed to be used in many module loaders, or with no module loading (global variables).\nThese are known as UMD modules.\nThese libraries can be accessed through either an import or a global variable.\nFor example:\nmath-lib.d.ts\nexport function isPrime(x: number): boolean;\nexport as namespace mathLib;\n\nThe library can then be used as an import within modules:\nimport { isPrime } from \"math-lib\";\nisPrime(2);\nmathLib.isPrime(2); // ERROR: can't use the global definition from inside a module\n\nIt can also be used as a global variable, but only inside of a script.\n(A script is a file with no imports or exports.)\nmathLib.isPrime(2);\n\nGuidance for structuring modules\nExport as close to top-level as possible\nConsumers of your module should have as little friction as possible when using things that you export.\nAdding too many levels of nesting tends to be cumbersome, so think carefully about how you want to structure things.\nExporting a namespace from your module is an example of adding too many layers of nesting.\nWhile namespaces sometime have their uses, they add an extra level of indirection when using modules.\nThis can quickly become a pain point for users, and is usually unnecessary.\nStatic methods on an exported class have a similar problem - the class itself adds a layer of nesting.\nUnless it increases expressivity or intent in a clearly useful way, consider simply exporting a helper function.\nIf you're only exporting a single class or function, use export default\nJust as \"exporting near the top-level\" reduces friction on your module's consumers, so does introducing a default export.\nIf a module's primary purpose is to house one specific export, then you should consider exporting it as a default export.\nThis makes both importing and actually using the import a little easier.\nFor example:\nMyClass.ts\nexport default class SomeType {\n  constructor() { ... }\n}\n\nMyFunc.ts\nexport default function getThing() { return \"thing\"; }\n\nConsumer.ts\nimport t from \"./MyClass\";\nimport f from \"./MyFunc\";\nlet x = new t();\nconsole.log(f());\n\nThis is optimal for consumers. They can name your type whatever they want (t in this case) and don't have to do any excessive dotting to find your objects.\nIf you're exporting multiple objects, put them all at top-level\nMyThings.ts\nexport class SomeType { /* ... */ }\nexport function someFunc() { /* ... */ }\n\nConversely when importing:\nExplicitly list imported names\nConsumer.ts\nimport { SomeType, someFunc } from \"./MyThings\";\nlet x = new SomeType();\nlet y = someFunc();\n\nUse the namespace import pattern if you're importing a large number of things\nMyLargeModule.ts\nexport class Dog { ... }\nexport class Cat { ... }\nexport class Tree { ... }\nexport class Flower { ... }\n\nConsumer.ts\nimport * as myLargeModule from \"./MyLargeModule.ts\";\nlet x = new myLargeModule.Dog();\n\nRe-export to extend\nOften you will need to extend functionality on a module.\nA common JS pattern is to augment the original object with extensions, similar to how JQuery extensions work.\nAs we've mentioned before, modules do not merge like global namespace objects would.\nThe recommended solution is to not mutate the original object, but rather export a new entity that provides the new functionality.\nConsider a simple calculator implementation defined in module Calculator.ts.\nThe module also exports a helper function to test the calculator functionality by passing a list of input strings and writing the result at the end.\nCalculator.ts\nexport class Calculator {\n    private current = 0;\n    private memory = 0;\n    private operator: string;\n\n    protected processDigit(digit: string, currentValue: number) {\n        if (digit >= \"0\" && digit = 0) {\n            return operator;\n        }\n    }\n\n    protected evaluateOperator(operator: string, left: number, right: number): number {\n        switch (this.operator) {\n            case \"+\": return left + right;\n            case \"-\": return left - right;\n            case \"*\": return left * right;\n            case \"/\": return left / right;\n        }\n    }\n\n    private evaluate() {\n        if (this.operator) {\n            this.memory = this.evaluateOperator(this.operator, this.memory, this.current);\n        }\n        else {\n            this.memory = this.current;\n        }\n        this.current = 0;\n    }\n\n    public handelChar(char: string) {\n        if (char === \"=\") {\n            this.evaluate();\n            return;\n        }\n        else {\n            let value = this.processDigit(char, this.current);\n            if (value !== undefined) {\n                this.current = value;\n                return;\n            }\n            else {\n                let value = this.processOperator(char);\n                if (value !== undefined) {\n                    this.evaluate();\n                    this.operator = value;\n                    return;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        throw new Error(`Unsupported input: '${char}'`);\n    }\n\n    public getResult() {\n        return this.memory;\n    }\n}\n\nexport function test(c: Calculator, input: string) {\n    for (let i = 0; i \nHere is a simple test for the calculator using the exposed test function.\nTestCalculator.ts\nimport { Calculator, test } from \"./Calculator\";\n\n\nlet c = new Calculator();\ntest(c, \"1+2*33/11=\"); // prints 9\n\nNow to extend this to add support for input with numbers in bases other than 10, let's create ProgrammerCalculator.ts\nProgrammerCalculator.ts\nimport { Calculator } from \"./Calculator\";\n\nclass ProgrammerCalculator extends Calculator {\n    static digits = [\"0\", \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\", \"9\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\"];\n\n    constructor(public base: number) {\n        super();\n        if (base  ProgrammerCalculator.digits.length) {\n            throw new Error(\"base has to be within 0 to 16 inclusive.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    protected processDigit(digit: string, currentValue: number) {\n        if (ProgrammerCalculator.digits.indexOf(digit) >= 0) {\n            return currentValue * this.base + ProgrammerCalculator.digits.indexOf(digit);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Export the new extended calculator as Calculator\nexport { ProgrammerCalculator as Calculator };\n\n// Also, export the helper function\nexport { test } from \"./Calculator\";\n\nThe new module ProgrammerCalculator exports an API shape similar to that of the original Calculator module, but does not augment any objects in the original module.\nHere is a test for our ProgrammerCalculator class:\nTestProgrammerCalculator.ts\nimport { Calculator, test } from \"./ProgrammerCalculator\";\n\nlet c = new Calculator(2);\ntest(c, \"001+010=\"); // prints 3\n\nDo not use namespaces in modules\nWhen first moving to a module-based organization, a common tendency is to wrap exports in an additional layer of namespaces.\nModules have their own scope, and only exported declarations are visible from outside the module.\nWith this in mind, namespace provide very little, if any, value when working with modules.\nOn the organization front, namespaces are handy for grouping together logically-related objects and types in the global scope.\nFor example, in C#, you're going to find all the collection types in System.Collections.\nBy organizing our types into hierarchical namespaces, we provide a good \"discovery\" experience for users of those types.\nModules, on the other hand, are already present in a file system, necessarily.\nWe have to resolve them by path and filename, so there's a logical organization scheme for us to use.\nWe can have a /collections/generic/ folder with a list module in it.\nNamespaces are important to avoid naming collisions in the global scope.\nFor example, you might have My.Application.Customer.AddForm and My.Application.Order.AddForm -- two types with the same name, but a different namespace.\nThis, however, is not an issue with modules.\nWithin a module, there's no plausible reason to have two objects with the same name.\nFrom the consumption side, the consumer of any given module gets to pick the name that they will use to refer to the module, so accidental naming conflicts are impossible.\n\nFor more discussion about modules and namespaces see Namespaces and Modules.\n\nRed Flags\nAll of the following are red flags for module structuring. Double-check that you're not trying to namespace your external modules if any of these apply to your files:\n\nA file whose only top-level declaration is export namespace Foo { ... } (remove Foo and move everything 'up' a level)\nA file that has a single export class or export function (consider using export default)\nMultiple files that have the same export namespace Foo { at top-level (don't think that these are going to combine into one Foo!)\n\n"},"pages/Namespaces.html":{"url":"pages/Namespaces.html","title":"Namespaces","keywords":"","body":"\nA note about terminology:\nIt's important to note that in TypeScript 1.5, the nomenclature has changed.\n\"Internal modules\" are now \"namespaces\".\n\"External modules\" are now simply \"modules\", as to align with ECMAScript 2015's terminology, (namely that module X { is equivalent to the now-preferred namespace X {).\n\nIntroduction\nThis post outlines the various ways to organize your code using namespaces (previously \"internal modules\") in TypeScript.\nAs we alluded in our note about terminology, \"internal modules\" are now referred to as \"namespaces\".\nAdditionally, anywhere the module keyword was used when declaring an internal module, the namespace keyword can and should be used instead.\nThis avoids confusing new users by overloading them with similarly named terms.\nFirst steps\nLet's start with the program we'll be using as our example throughout this page.\nWe've written a small set of simplistic string validators, as you might write to check a user's input on a form in a webpage or check the format of an externally-provided data file.\nValidators in a single file\ninterface StringValidator {\n    isAcceptable(s: string): boolean;\n}\n\nlet lettersRegexp = /^[A-Za-z]+$/;\nlet numberRegexp = /^[0-9]+$/;\n\nclass LettersOnlyValidator implements StringValidator {\n    isAcceptable(s: string) {\n        return lettersRegexp.test(s);\n    }\n}\n\nclass ZipCodeValidator implements StringValidator {\n    isAcceptable(s: string) {\n        return s.length === 5 && numberRegexp.test(s);\n    }\n}\n\n// Some samples to try\nlet strings = [\"Hello\", \"98052\", \"101\"];\n\n// Validators to use\nlet validators: { [s: string]: StringValidator; } = {};\nvalidators[\"ZIP code\"] = new ZipCodeValidator();\nvalidators[\"Letters only\"] = new LettersOnlyValidator();\n\n// Show whether each string passed each validator\nfor (let s of strings) {\n    for (let name in validators) {\n        let isMatch = validators[name].isAcceptable(s);\n        console.log(`'${ s }' ${ isMatch ? \"matches\" : \"does not match\" } '${ name }'.`);\n    }\n}\n\nNamespacing\nAs we add more validators, we're going to want to have some kind of organization scheme so that we can keep track of our types and not worry about name collisions with other objects.\nInstead of putting lots of different names into the global namespace, let's wrap up our objects into a namespace.\nIn this example, we'll move all validator-related entities into a namespace called Validation.\nBecause we want the interfaces and classes here to be visible outside the namespace, we preface them with export.\nConversely, the variables lettersRegexp and numberRegexp are implementation details, so they are left unexported and will not be visible to code outside the namespace.\nIn the test code at the bottom of the file, we now need to qualify the names of the types when used outside the namespace, e.g. Validation.LettersOnlyValidator.\nNamespaced Validators\nnamespace Validation {\n    export interface StringValidator {\n        isAcceptable(s: string): boolean;\n    }\n\n    const lettersRegexp = /^[A-Za-z]+$/;\n    const numberRegexp = /^[0-9]+$/;\n\n    export class LettersOnlyValidator implements StringValidator {\n        isAcceptable(s: string) {\n            return lettersRegexp.test(s);\n        }\n    }\n\n    export class ZipCodeValidator implements StringValidator {\n        isAcceptable(s: string) {\n            return s.length === 5 && numberRegexp.test(s);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Some samples to try\nlet strings = [\"Hello\", \"98052\", \"101\"];\n\n// Validators to use\nlet validators: { [s: string]: Validation.StringValidator; } = {};\nvalidators[\"ZIP code\"] = new Validation.ZipCodeValidator();\nvalidators[\"Letters only\"] = new Validation.LettersOnlyValidator();\n\n// Show whether each string passed each validator\nfor (let s of strings) {\n    for (let name in validators) {\n        console.log(`\"${ s }\" - ${ validators[name].isAcceptable(s) ? \"matches\" : \"does not match\" } ${ name }`);\n    }\n}\n\nSplitting Across Files\nAs our application grows, we'll want to split the code across multiple files to make it easier to maintain.\nMulti-file namespaces\nHere, we'll split our Validation namespace across many files.\nEven though the files are separate, they can each contribute to the same namespace and can be consumed as if they were all defined in one place.\nBecause there are dependencies between files, we'll add reference tags to tell the compiler about the relationships between the files.\nOur test code is otherwise unchanged.\nValidation.ts\nnamespace Validation {\n    export interface StringValidator {\n        isAcceptable(s: string): boolean;\n    }\n}\n\nLettersOnlyValidator.ts\n/// \nnamespace Validation {\n    const lettersRegexp = /^[A-Za-z]+$/;\n    export class LettersOnlyValidator implements StringValidator {\n        isAcceptable(s: string) {\n            return lettersRegexp.test(s);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nZipCodeValidator.ts\n/// \nnamespace Validation {\n    const numberRegexp = /^[0-9]+$/;\n    export class ZipCodeValidator implements StringValidator {\n        isAcceptable(s: string) {\n            return s.length === 5 && numberRegexp.test(s);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nTest.ts\n/// \n/// \n/// \n\n// Some samples to try\nlet strings = [\"Hello\", \"98052\", \"101\"];\n\n// Validators to use\nlet validators: { [s: string]: Validation.StringValidator; } = {};\nvalidators[\"ZIP code\"] = new Validation.ZipCodeValidator();\nvalidators[\"Letters only\"] = new Validation.LettersOnlyValidator();\n\n// Show whether each string passed each validator\nfor (let s of strings) {\n    for (let name in validators) {\n        console.log(`\"${ s }\" - ${ validators[name].isAcceptable(s) ? \"matches\" : \"does not match\" } ${ name }`);\n    }\n}\n\nOnce there are multiple files involved, we'll need to make sure all of the compiled code gets loaded.\nThere are two ways of doing this.\nFirst, we can use concatenated output using the --outFile flag to compile all of the input files into a single JavaScript output file:\ntsc --outFile sample.js Test.ts\n\nThe compiler will automatically order the output file based on the reference tags present in the files. You can also specify each file individually:\ntsc --outFile sample.js Validation.ts LettersOnlyValidator.ts ZipCodeValidator.ts Test.ts\n\nAlternatively, we can use per-file compilation (the default) to emit one JavaScript file for each input file.\nIf multiple JS files get produced, we'll need to use  tags on our webpage to load each emitted file in the appropriate order, for example:\nMyTestPage.html (excerpt)\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\nAliases\nAnother way that you can simplify working with of namespaces is to use import q = x.y.z to create shorter names for commonly-used objects.\nNot to be confused with the import x = require(\"name\") syntax used to load modules, this syntax simply creates an alias for the specified symbol.\nYou can use these sorts of imports (commonly referred to as aliases) for any kind of identifier, including objects created from module imports.\nnamespace Shapes {\n    export namespace Polygons {\n        export class Triangle { }\n        export class Square { }\n    }\n}\n\nimport polygons = Shapes.Polygons;\nlet sq = new polygons.Square(); // Same as 'new Shapes.Polygons.Square()'\n\nNotice that we don't use the require keyword; instead we assign directly from the qualified name of the symbol we're importing.\nThis is similar to using var, but also works on the type and namespace meanings of the imported symbol.\nImportantly, for values, import is a distinct reference from the original symbol, so changes to an aliased var will not be reflected in the original variable.\nWorking with Other JavaScript Libraries\nTo describe the shape of libraries not written in TypeScript, we need to declare the API that the library exposes.\nBecause most JavaScript libraries expose only a few top-level objects, namespaces are a good way to represent them.\nWe call declarations that don't define an implementation \"ambient\".\nTypically these are defined in .d.ts files.\nIf you're familiar with C/C++, you can think of these as .h files.\nLet's look at a few examples.\nAmbient Namespaces\nThe popular library D3 defines its functionality in a global object called d3.\nBecause this library is loaded through a  tag (instead of a module loader), its declaration uses namespaces to define its shape.\nFor the TypeScript compiler to see this shape, we use an ambient namespace declaration.\nFor example, we could begin writing it as follows:\nD3.d.ts (simplified excerpt)\ndeclare namespace D3 {\n    export interface Selectors {\n        select: {\n            (selector: string): Selection;\n            (element: EventTarget): Selection;\n        };\n    }\n\n    export interface Event {\n        x: number;\n        y: number;\n    }\n\n    export interface Base extends Selectors {\n        event: Event;\n    }\n}\n\ndeclare var d3: D3.Base;\n\n"},"pages/Namespaces and Modules.html":{"url":"pages/Namespaces and Modules.html","title":"Namespaces and Modules","keywords":"","body":"\nA note about

namespaces and modules in TypeScript.\nWe'll also go over some advanced topics of how to use namespaces and modules, and address some common pitfalls when using them in TypeScript.\nSee the Modules documentation for more information about modules.\nSee the Namespaces documentation for more information about namespaces.\nUsing Namespaces\nNamespaces are simply named JavaScript objects in the global namespace.\nThis makes namespaces a very simple construct to use.\nThey can span multiple files, and can be concatenated using --outFile.\nNamespaces can be a good way to structure your code in a Web Application, with all dependencies included as  tags in your HTML page.\nJust like all global namespace pollution, it can be hard to identify component dependencies, especially in a large application.\nUsing Modules\nJust like namespaces, modules can contain both code and declarations.\nThe main difference is that modules declare their dependencies.\nModules also have a dependency on a module loader (such as CommonJs/Require.js).\nFor a small JS application this might not be optimal, but for larger applications, the cost comes with long term modularity and maintainability benefits.\nModules provide for better code reuse, stronger isolation and better tooling support for bundling.\nIt is also worth noting that, for Node.js applications, modules are the default and the recommended approach to structure your code.\nStarting with ECMAScript 2015, modules are native part of the language, and should be supported by all compliant engine implementations.\nThus, for new projects modules would be the recommended code organization mechanism.\nPitfalls of Namespaces and Modules\nIn this section we'll describe various common pitfalls in using namespaces and modules, and how to avoid them.\n/// -ing a module\nA common mistake is to try to use the ///  syntax to refer to a module file, rather than using an import statement.\nTo understand the distinction, we first need to understand how compiler can locate the type information for a module based on the path of an import (e.g. the ... in import x from \"...\";, import x = require(\"...\");, etc.) path.\nThe compiler will try to find a .ts, .tsx, and then a .d.ts with the appropriate path.\nIf a specific file could not be found, then the compiler will look for an ambient module declaration.\nRecall that these need to be declared in a .d.ts file.\n\nmyModules.d.ts\n// In a .d.ts file or .ts file that is not a module:\ndeclare module \"SomeModule\" {\n    export function fn(): string;\n}\n\n\nmyOtherModule.ts\n/// \nimport * as m from \"SomeModule\";\n\n\n\nThe reference tag here allows us to locate the declaration file that contains the declaration for the ambient module.\nThis is how the node.d.ts file that several of the TypeScript samples use is consumed.\nNeedless Namespacing\nIf you're converting a program from namespaces to modules, it can be easy to end up with a file that looks like this:\n\nshapes.ts\nexport namespace Shapes {\n    export class Triangle { /* ... */ }\n    export class Square { /* ... */ }\n}\n\n\n\nThe top-level module here Shapes wraps up Triangle and Square for no reason.\nThis is confusing and annoying for consumers of your module:\n\nshapeConsumer.ts\nimport * as shapes from \"./shapes\";\nlet t = new shapes.Shapes.Triangle(); // shapes.Shapes?\n\n\n\nA key feature of modules in TypeScript is that two different modules will never contribute names to the same scope.\nBecause the consumer of a module decides what name to assign it, there's no need to proactively wrap up the exported symbols in a namespace.\nTo reiterate why you shouldn't try to namespace your module contents, the general idea of namespacing is to provide logical grouping of constructs and to prevent name collisions.\nBecause the module file itself is already a logical grouping, and its top-level name is defined by the code that imports it, it's unnecessary to use an additional module layer for exported objects.\nHere's a revised example:\n\nshapes.ts\nexport class Triangle { /* ... */ }\nexport class Square { /* ... */ }\n\n\nshapeConsumer.ts\nimport * as shapes from \"./shapes\";\nlet t = new shapes.Triangle();\n\n\n\nTrade-offs of Modules\nJust as there is a one-to-one correspondence between JS files and modules, TypeScript has a one-to-one correspondence between module source files and their emitted JS files.\nOne effect of this is that it's not possible to concatenate multiple module source files depending on the module system you target.\nFor instance, you can't use the outFile option while targeting commonjs or umd, but with TypeScript 1.8 and later, it's possible to use outFile when targeting amd or system.\n"},"pages/Module Resolution.html":{"url":"pages/Module Resolution.html","title":"Module Resolution","keywords":"","body":"\nThis section assumes some basic knowledge about modules.\nPlease see the Modules documentation for more information.\n\nModule resolution is the process the compiler uses to figure out what an import refers to.\nConsider an import statement like import { a } from \"moduleA\";\nin order to check any use of a, the compiler needs to know exactly what it represents, and will need to check its definition moduleA.\nAt this point, the compiler will ask \"what's the shape of moduleA?\"\nWhile this sounds straightforward, moduleA could be defined in one of your own .ts/.tsx files, or in a .d.ts that your code depends on.\nFirst, the compiler will try to locate a file that represents the imported module.\nTo do so the compiler follows one of two different strategies: Classic or Node.\nThese strategies tell the compiler where to look for moduleA.\nIf that didn't work and if the module name is non-relative (and in the case of \"moduleA\", it is), then the compiler will attempt to locate an ambient module declaration.\nWe'll cover non-relative imports next.\nFinally, if the compiler could not resolve the module, it will log an error.\nIn this case, the error would be something like error TS2307: Cannot find module 'moduleA'.\nRelative vs. Non-relative module imports\nModule imports are resolved differently based on whether the module reference is relative or non-relative.\nA relative import is one that starts with /, ./ or ../.\nSome examples include:\n\nimport Entry from \"./components/Entry\";\nimport { DefaultHeaders } from \"../constants/http\";\nimport \"/mod\";\n\nAny other import is considered non-relative.\nSome examples include:\n\nimport * as $ from \"jquery\";\nimport { Component } from \"@angular/core\";\n\nA relative import is resolved relative to the importing file and cannot resolve to an ambient module declaration.\nYou should use relative imports for your own modules that are guaranteed to maintain their relative location at runtime.\nA non-relative import can be resolved relative to baseUrl, or through path mapping, which we'll cover below.\nThey can also resolve to ambient module declarations.\nUse non-relative paths when importing any of your external dependencies.\nModule Resolution Strategies\nThere are two possible module resolution strategies: Node and Classic.\nYou can use the --moduleResolution flag to specify the module resolution strategy.\nIf not specified, the default is Classic for --module AMD | System | ES2015 or Node otherwise.\nClassic\nThis used to be TypeScript's default resolution strategy.\nNowadays, this strategy is mainly present for backward compatibility.\nA relative import will be resolved relative to the importing file.\nSo import { b } from \"./moduleB\" in source file /root/src/folder/A.ts would result in the following lookups:\n\n/root/src/folder/moduleB.ts\n/root/src/folder/moduleB.d.ts\n\nFor non-relative module imports, however, the compiler walks up the directory tree starting with the directory containing the importing file, trying to locate a matching definition file.\nFor example:\nA non-relative import to moduleB such as import { b } from \"moduleB\", in a source file /root/src/folder/A.ts, would result in attempting the following locations for locating \"moduleB\":\n\n/root/src/folder/moduleB.ts\n/root/src/folder/moduleB.d.ts\n/root/src/moduleB.ts\n/root/src/moduleB.d.ts\n/root/moduleB.ts\n/root/moduleB.d.ts\n/moduleB.ts\n/moduleB.d.ts\n\nNode\nThis resolution strategy attempts to mimic the Node.js module resolution mechanism at runtime.\nThe full Node.js resolution algorithm is outlined in Node.js module documentation.\nHow Node.js resolves modules\nTo understand what steps the TS compiler will follow, it is important to shed some light on Node.js modules.\nTraditionally, imports in Node.js are performed by calling a function named require.\nThe behavior Node.js takes will differ depending on if require is given a relative path or a non-relative path.\nRelative paths are fairly straightforward.\nAs an example, let's consider a file located at /root/src/moduleA.js, which contains the import var x = require(\"./moduleB\");\nNode.js resolves that import in the following order:\n\nAs the file named /root/src/moduleB.js, if it exists.\n\nAs the folder /root/src/moduleB if it contains a file named package.json that specifies a \"main\" module.\nIn our example, if Node.js found the file /root/src/moduleB/package.json containing { \"main\": \"lib/mainModule.js\" }, then Node.js will refer to /root/src/moduleB/lib/mainModule.js.\n\nAs the folder /root/src/moduleB if it contains a file named index.js.\nThat file is implicitly considered that folder's \"main\" module.\n\n\nYou can read more about this in Node.js documentation on file modules and folder modules.\nHowever, resolution for a non-relative module name is performed differently.\nNode will look for your modules in special folders named node_modules.\nA node_modules folder can be on the same level as the current file, or higher up in the directory chain.\nNode will walk up the directory chain, looking through each node_modules until it finds the module you tried to load.\nFollowing up our example above, consider if /root/src/moduleA.js instead used a non-relative path and had the import var x = require(\"moduleB\");.\nNode would then try to resolve moduleB to each of the locations until one worked.\n\n/root/src/node_modules/moduleB.js\n/root/src/node_modules/moduleB/package.json (if it specifies a \"main\" property)\n/root/src/node_modules/moduleB/index.js\n\n/root/node_modules/moduleB.js\n/root/node_modules/moduleB/package.json (if it specifies a \"main\" property)\n/root/node_modules/moduleB/index.js\n\n/node_modules/moduleB.js\n/node_modules/moduleB/package.json (if it specifies a \"main\" property)\n/node_modules/moduleB/index.js\n\nNotice that Node.js jumped up a directory in steps (4) and (7).\nYou can read more about the process in Node.js documentation on loading modules from node_modules.\nHow TypeScript resolves modules\nTypeScript will mimic the Node.js run-time resolution strategy in order to locate definition files for modules at compile-time.\nTo accomplish this, TypeScript overlays the TypeScript source file extensions (.ts, .tsx, and .d.ts) over the Node's resolution logic.\nTypeScript will also use a field in package.json named \"types\" to mirror the purpose of \"main\" - the compiler will use it to find the \"main\" definition file to consult.\nFor example, an import statement like import { b } from \"./moduleB\" in  /root/src/moduleA.ts would result in attempting the following locations for locating \"./moduleB\":\n\n/root/src/moduleB.ts\n/root/src/moduleB.tsx\n/root/src/moduleB.d.ts\n/root/src/moduleB/package.json (if it specifies a \"types\" property)\n/root/src/moduleB/index.ts\n/root/src/moduleB/index.tsx\n/root/src/moduleB/index.d.ts\n\nRecall that Node.js looked for a file named moduleB.js, then an applicable package.json, and then for an index.js.\nSimilarly a non-relative import will follow the Node.js resolution logic, first looking up a file, then looking up an applicable folder.\nSo import { b } from \"moduleB\" in source file /root/src/moduleA.ts would result in the following lookups:\n\n/root/src/node_modules/moduleB.ts\n/root/src/node_modules/moduleB.tsx\n/root/src/node_modules/moduleB.d.ts\n/root/src/node_modules/moduleB/package.json (if it specifies a \"types\" property)\n/root/src/node_modules/moduleB/index.ts\n/root/src/node_modules/moduleB/index.tsx\n/root/src/node_modules/moduleB/index.d.ts\n\n/root/node_modules/moduleB.ts\n/root/node_modules/moduleB.tsx\n/root/node_modules/moduleB.d.ts\n/root/node_modules/moduleB/package.json (if it specifies a \"types\" property)\n/root/node_modules/moduleB/index.ts\n/root/node_modules/moduleB/index.tsx\n/root/node_modules/moduleB/index.d.ts\n\n/node_modules/moduleB.ts\n/node_modules/moduleB.tsx\n/node_modules/moduleB.d.ts\n/node_modules/moduleB/package.json (if it specifies a \"types\" property)\n/node_modules/moduleB/index.ts\n/node_modules/moduleB/index.tsx\n/node_modules/moduleB/index.d.ts\n\nDon't be intimidated by the number of steps here - TypeScript is still only jumping up directories twice at steps (8) and (15).\nThis is really no more complex than what Node.js itself is doing.\nAdditional module resolution flags\nA project source layout sometimes does not match that of the output.\nUsually a set of build steps result in generating the final output.\nThese include compiling .ts files into .js, and copying dependencies from different source locations to a single output location.\nThe net result is that modules at runtime may have different names than the source files containing their definitions.\nOr module paths in the final output may not match their corresponding source file paths at compile time.\nThe TypeScript compiler has a set of additional flags to inform the compiler of transformations that are expected to happen to the sources to generate the final output.\nIt is important to note that the compiler will not perform any of these transformations;\nit just uses these pieces of information to guide the process of resolving a module import to its definition file.\nBase URL\nUsing a baseUrl is a common practice in applications using AMD module loaders where modules are \"deployed\" to a single folder at run-time.\nThe sources of these modules can live in different directories, but a build script will put them all together.\nSetting baseUrl informs the compiler where to find modules.\nAll module imports with non-relative names are assumed to be relative to the baseUrl.\nValue of baseUrl is determined as either:\n\nvalue of baseUrl command line argument (if given path is relative, it is computed based on current directory)\nvalue of baseUrl property in 'tsconfig.json' (if given path is relative, it is computed based on the location of 'tsconfig.json')\n\nNote that relative module imports are not impacted by setting the baseUrl, as they are always resolved relative to their importing files.\nYou can find more documentation on baseUrl in RequireJS and SystemJS documentation.\nPath mapping\nSometimes modules are not directly located under baseUrl.\nFor instance, an import to a module \"jquery\" would be translated at runtime to \"node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.slim.min.js\".\nLoaders use a mapping configuration to map module names to files at run-time, see RequireJs documentation and SystemJS documentation.\nThe TypeScript compiler supports the declaration of such mappings using \"paths\" property in tsconfig.json files.\nHere is an example for how to specify the \"paths\" property for jquery.\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\", // This must be specified if \"paths\" is.\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"jquery\": [\"node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery\"] // This mapping is relative to \"baseUrl\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nPlease notice that \"paths\" are resolved relative to \"baseUrl\".\nWhen setting \"baseUrl\" to another value than \".\", i.e. the directory of tsconfig.json, the mappings must be changed accordingly.\nSay, you set \"baseUrl\": \"./src\" in the above example, then jquery should be mapped to \"../node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery\".\nUsing \"paths\" also allows for more sophisticated mappings including multiple fall back locations.\nConsider a project configuration where only some modules are available in one location, and the rest are in another.\nA build step would put them all together in one place.\nThe project layout may look like:\nprojectRoot\n├── folder1\n│   ├── file1.ts (imports 'folder1/file2' and 'folder2/file3')\n│   └── file2.ts\n├── generated\n│   ├── folder1\n│   └── folder2\n│       └── file3.ts\n└── tsconfig.json\n\nThe corresponding tsconfig.json would look like:\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"*\": [\n        \"*\",\n        \"generated/*\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThis tells the compiler for any module import that matches the pattern \"*\" (i.e. all values), to look in two locations:\n\n\"*\": meaning the same name unchanged, so map  => /\n\"generated/*\" meaning the module name with an appended prefix \"generated\", so map  => /generated/\n\nFollowing this logic, the compiler will attempt to resolve the two imports as such:\n\nimport 'folder1/file2'\npattern '*' is matched and wildcard captures the whole module name\ntry first substitution in the list: '*' -> folder1/file2\nresult of substitution is non-relative name - combine it with baseUrl -> projectRoot/folder1/file2.ts.\nFile exists. Done.\n\n\nimport 'folder2/file3'\npattern '*' is matched and wildcard captures the whole module name\ntry first substitution in the list: '*' -> folder2/file3\nresult of substitution is non-relative name - combine it with baseUrl -> projectRoot/folder2/file3.ts.\nFile does not exist, move to the second substitution\nsecond substitution 'generated/*' -> generated/folder2/file3\nresult of substitution is non-relative name - combine it with baseUrl -> projectRoot/generated/folder2/file3.ts.\nFile exists. Done.\n\n\n\nVirtual Directories with rootDirs\nSometimes the project sources from multiple directories at compile time are all combined to generate a single output directory.\nThis can be viewed as a set of source directories create a \"virtual\" directory.\nUsing 'rootDirs', you can inform the compiler of the roots making up this \"virtual\" directory;\nand thus the compiler can resolve relative modules imports within these \"virtual\" directories as if were merged together in one directory.\nFor example consider this project structure:\n src\n └── views\n     └── view1.ts (imports './template1')\n     └── view2.ts\n\n generated\n └── templates\n         └── views\n             └── template1.ts (imports './view2')\n\nFiles in src/views are user code for some UI controls.\nFiles in generated/templates are UI template binding code auto-generated by a template generator as part of the build.\nA build step will copy the files in /src/views and /generated/templates/views to the same directory in the output.\nAt run-time, a view can expect its template to exist next to it, and thus should import it using a relative name as \"./template\".\nTo specify this relationship to the compiler, use\"rootDirs\".\n\"rootDirs\" specify a list of roots whose contents are expected to merge at run-time.\nSo following our example, the tsconfig.json file should look like:\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"rootDirs\": [\n      \"src/views\",\n      \"generated/templates/views\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nEvery time the compiler sees a relative module import in a subfolder of one of the rootDirs, it will attempt to look for this import in each of the entries of rootDirs.\nThe flexibility of rootDirs is not limited to specifying a list of physical source directories that are logically merged. The supplied array may include any number of ad hoc, arbitrary directory names, regardless of whether they exist or not. This allows the compiler to capture sophisticated bundling and runtime features such as conditional inclusion and project specific loader plugins in a type safe way.\nConsider an internationalization scenario where a build tool automatically generates locale specific bundles by interpolating a special path token, say #{locale}, as part of a relative module path such as ./#{locale}/messages. In this hypothetical setup the tool enumerates supported locales, mapping the abstracted path into ./zh/messages, ./de/messages, and so forth.\nAssume that each of these modules exports an array of strings. For example ./zh/messages might contain:\nexport default [\n    \"您好吗\",\n    \"很高兴认识你\"\n];\n\nBy leveraging rootDirs we can inform the compiler of this mapping and thereby allow it to safely resolve ./#{locale}/messages, even though the directory will never exist. For example, with the following tsconfig.json:\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"rootDirs\": [\n      \"src/zh\",\n      \"src/de\",\n      \"src/#{locale}\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nThe compiler will now resolve import messages from './#{locale}/messages' to import messages from './zh/messages' for tooling purposes, allowing development in a locale agnostic manner without compromising design time support.\nTracing module resolution\nAs discussed earlier, the compiler can visit files outside the current folder when resolving a module.\nThis can be hard when diagnosing why a module is not resolved, or is resolved to an incorrect definition.\nEnabling the compiler module resolution tracing using --traceResolution provides insight in what happened during the module resolution process.\nLet's say we have a sample application that uses the typescript module.\napp.ts has an import like import * as ts from \"typescript\".\n│   tsconfig.json\n├───node_modules\n│   └───typescript\n│       └───lib\n│               typescript.d.ts\n└───src\n        app.ts\n\nInvoking the compiler with --traceResolution\ntsc --traceResolution\n\nResults in an output such as:\n======== Resolving module 'typescript' from 'src/app.ts'. ========\nModule resolution kind is not specified, using 'NodeJs'.\nLoading module 'typescript' from 'node_modules' folder.\nFile 'src/node_modules/typescript.ts' does not exist.\nFile 'src/node_modules/typescript.tsx' does not exist.\nFile 'src/node_modules/typescript.d.ts' does not exist.\nFile 'src/node_modules/typescript/package.json' does not exist.\nFile 'node_modules/typescript.ts' does not exist.\nFile 'node_modules/typescript.tsx' does not exist.\nFile 'node_modules/typescript.d.ts' does not exist.\nFound 'package.json' at 'node_modules/typescript/package.json'.\n'package.json' has 'types' field './lib/typescript.d.ts' that references 'node_modules/typescript/lib/typescript.d.ts'.\nFile 'node_modules/typescript/lib/typescript.d.ts' exist - use it as a module resolution result.\n======== Module name 'typescript' was successfully resolved to 'node_modules/typescript/lib/typescript.d.ts'. ========\n\nThings to look out for\n\nName and location of the import\n\n======== Resolving module 'typescript' from 'src/app.ts'. ========\n\n\nThe strategy the compiler is following\n\nModule resolution kind is not specified, using 'NodeJs'.\n\n\nLoading of types from npm packages\n\n'package.json' has 'types' field './lib/typescript.d.ts' that references 'node_modules/typescript/lib/typescript.d.ts'.\n\n\nFinal result\n\n======== Module name 'typescript' was successfully resolved to 'node_modules/typescript/lib/typescript.d.ts'. ========\n\n\n\nUsing --noResolve\nNormally the compiler will attempt to resolve all module imports before it starts the compilation process.\nEvery time it successfully resolves an import to a file, the file is added to the set of files the compiler will process later on.\nThe --noResolve compiler options instructs the compiler not to \"add\" any files to the compilation that were not passed on the command line.\nIt will still try to resolve the module to files, but if the file is not specified, it will not be included.\nFor instance:\napp.ts\nimport * as A from \"moduleA\" // OK, 'moduleA' passed on the command-line\nimport * as B from \"moduleB\" // Error TS2307: Cannot find module 'moduleB'.\n\ntsc app.ts moduleA.ts --noResolve\n\nCompiling app.ts using --noResolve should result in:\n\nCorrectly finding moduleA as it was passed on the command-line.\nError for not finding moduleB as it was not passed.\n\nCommon Questions\nWhy does a module in the exclude list still get picked up by the compiler?\ntsconfig.json turns a folder into a “project”.\nWithout specifying any “exclude” or “files” entries, all files in the folder containing the tsconfig.json and all its sub-directories are included in your compilation.\nIf you want to exclude some of the files use “exclude”, if you would rather specify all the files instead of letting the compiler look them up, use “files”.\nThat was tsconfig.json automatic inclusion.\nThat does not embed module resolution as discussed above.\nIf the compiler identified a file as a target of a module import, it will be included in the compilation regardless if it was excluded in the previous steps.\nSo to exclude a file from the compilation, you need to exclude it and all files that have an import or ///  directive to it.\n"},"pages/Declaration Merging.html":{"url":"pages/Declaration Merging.html","title":"Declaration Merging","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nSome of the unique concepts in TypeScript describe the shape of JavaScript objects at the type level.\nOne example that is especially unique to TypeScript is the concept of 'declaration merging'.\nUnderstanding this concept will give you an advantage when working with existing JavaScript.\nIt also opens the door to more advanced abstraction concepts.\nFor the purposes of this article, \"declaration merging\" means that the compiler merges two separate declarations declared with the same name into a single definition.\nThis merged definition has the features of both of the original declarations.\nAny number of declarations can be merged; it's not limited to just two declarations.\nBasic Concepts\nIn TypeScript, a declaration creates entities in at least one of three groups: namespace, type, or value.\nNamespace-creating declarations create a namespace, which contains names that are accessed using a dotted notation.\nType-creating declarations do just that: they create a type that is visible with the declared shape and bound to the given name.\nLastly, value-creating declarations create values that are visible in the output JavaScript.\n\n\n\nDeclaration Type\nNamespace\nType\nValue\n\n\n\n\nNamespace\nX\n\nX\n\n\nClass\n\nX\nX\n\n\nEnum\n\nX\nX\n\n\nInterface\n\nX\n\n\n\nType Alias\n\nX\n\n\n\nFunction\n\n\nX\n\n\nVariable\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nUnderstanding what is created with each declaration will help you understand what is merged when you perform a declaration merge.\nMerging Interfaces\nThe simplest, and perhaps most common, type of declaration merging is interface merging.\nAt the most basic level, the merge mechanically joins the members of both declarations into a single interface with the same name.\ninterface Box {\n    height: number;\n    width: number;\n}\n\ninterface Box {\n    scale: number;\n}\n\nlet box: Box = {height: 5, width: 6, scale: 10};\n\nNon-function members of the interfaces should be unique.\nIf they are not unique, they must be of the same type.\nThe compiler will issue an error if the interfaces both declare a non-function member of the same name, but of different types.\nFor function members, each function member of the same name is treated as describing an overload of the same function.\nOf note, too, is that in the case of interface A merging with later interface A, the second interface will have a higher precedence than the first.\nThat is, in the example:\ninterface Cloner {\n    clone(animal: Animal): Animal;\n}\n\ninterface Cloner {\n    clone(animal: Sheep): Sheep;\n}\n\ninterface Cloner {\n    clone(animal: Dog): Dog;\n    clone(animal: Cat): Cat;\n}\n\nThe three interfaces will merge to create a single declaration as so:\ninterface Cloner {\n    clone(animal: Dog): Dog;\n    clone(animal: Cat): Cat;\n    clone(animal: Sheep): Sheep;\n    clone(animal: Animal): Animal;\n}\n\nNotice that the elements of each group maintains the same order, but the groups themselves are merged with later overload sets ordered first.\nOne exception to this rule is specialized signatures.\nIf a signature has a parameter whose type is a single string literal type (e.g. not a union of string literals), then it will be bubbled toward the top of its merged overload list.\nFor instance, the following interfaces will merge together:\ninterface Document {\n    createElement(tagName: any): Element;\n}\ninterface Document {\n    createElement(tagName: \"div\"): HTMLDivElement;\n    createElement(tagName: \"span\"): HTMLSpanElement;\n}\ninterface Document {\n    createElement(tagName: string): HTMLElement;\n    createElement(tagName: \"canvas\"): HTMLCanvasElement;\n}\n\nThe resulting merged declaration of Document will be the following:\ninterface Document {\n    createElement(tagName: \"canvas\"): HTMLCanvasElement;\n    createElement(tagName: \"div\"): HTMLDivElement;\n    createElement(tagName: \"span\"): HTMLSpanElement;\n    createElement(tagName: string): HTMLElement;\n    createElement(tagName: any): Element;\n}\n\nMerging Namespaces\nSimilarly to interfaces, namespaces of the same name will also merge their members.\nSince namespaces create both a namespace and a value, we need to understand how both merge.\nTo merge the namespaces, type definitions from exported interfaces declared in each namespace are themselves merged, forming a single namespace with merged interface definitions inside.\nTo merge the namespace value, at each declaration site, if a namespace already exists with the given name, it is further extended by taking the existing namespace and adding the exported members of the second namespace to the first.\nThe declaration merge of Animals in this example:\nnamespace Animals {\n    export class Zebra { }\n}\n\nnamespace Animals {\n    export interface Legged { numberOfLegs: number; }\n    export class Dog { }\n}\n\nis equivalent to:\nnamespace Animals {\n    export interface Legged { numberOfLegs: number; }\n\n    export class Zebra { }\n    export class Dog { }\n}\n\nThis model of namespace merging is a helpful starting place, but we also need to understand what happens with non-exported members.\nNon-exported members are only visible in the original (un-merged) namespace. This means that after merging, merged members that came from other declarations cannot see non-exported members.\nWe can see this more clearly in this example:\nnamespace Animal {\n    let haveMuscles = true;\n\n    export function animalsHaveMuscles() {\n        return haveMuscles;\n    }\n}\n\nnamespace Animal {\n    export function doAnimalsHaveMuscles() {\n        return haveMuscles;  // \nBecause haveMuscles is not exported, only the animalsHaveMuscles function that shares the same un-merged namespace can see the symbol.\nThe doAnimalsHaveMuscles function, even though it's part of the merged Animal namespace can not see this un-exported member.\nMerging Namespaces with Classes, Functions, and Enums\nNamespaces are flexible enough to also merge with other types of declarations.\nTo do so, the namespace declaration must follow the declaration it will merge with. The resulting declaration has properties of both declaration types.\nTypeScript uses this capability to model some of the patterns in JavaScript as well as other programming languages.\nMerging Namespaces with Classes\nThis gives the user a way of describing inner classes.\nclass Album {\n    label: Album.AlbumLabel;\n}\nnamespace Album {\n    export class AlbumLabel { }\n}\n\nThe visibility rules for merged members is the same as described in the 'Merging Namespaces' section, so we must export the AlbumLabel class for the merged class to see it.\nThe end result is a class managed inside of another class.\nYou can also use namespaces to add more static members to an existing class.\nIn addition to the pattern of inner classes, you may also be familiar with JavaScript practice of creating a function and then extending the function further by adding properties onto the function.\nTypeScript uses declaration merging to build up definitions like this in a type-safe way.\nfunction buildLabel(name: string): string {\n    return buildLabel.prefix + name + buildLabel.suffix;\n}\n\nnamespace buildLabel {\n    export let suffix = \"\";\n    export let prefix = \"Hello, \";\n}\n\nalert(buildLabel(\"Sam Smith\"));\n\nSimilarly, namespaces can be used to extend enums with static members:\nenum Color {\n    red = 1,\n    green = 2,\n    blue = 4\n}\n\nnamespace Color {\n    export function mixColor(colorName: string) {\n        if (colorName == \"yellow\") {\n            return Color.red + Color.green;\n        }\n        else if (colorName == \"white\") {\n            return Color.red + Color.green + Color.blue;\n        }\n        else if (colorName == \"magenta\") {\n            return Color.red + Color.blue;\n        }\n        else if (colorName == \"cyan\") {\n            return Color.green + Color.blue;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nDisallowed Merges\nNot all merges are allowed in TypeScript.\nCurrently, classes can not merge with other classes or with variables.\nFor information on mimicking class merging, see the Mixins in TypeScript section.\nModule Augmentation\nAlthough JavaScript modules do not support merging, you can patch existing objects by importing and then updating them.\nLet's look at a toy Observable example:\n// observable.js\nexport class Observable {\n    // ... implementation left as an exercise for the reader ...\n}\n\n// map.js\nimport { Observable } from \"./observable\";\nObservable.prototype.map = function (f) {\n    // ... another exercise for the reader\n}\n\nThis works fine in TypeScript too, but the compiler doesn't know about Observable.prototype.map.\nYou can use module augmentation to tell the compiler about it:\n// observable.ts stays the same\n// map.ts\nimport { Observable } from \"./observable\";\ndeclare module \"./observable\" {\n    interface Observable {\n        map(f: (x: T) => U): Observable;\n    }\n}\nObservable.prototype.map = function (f) {\n    // ... another exercise for the reader\n}\n\n\n// consumer.ts\nimport { Observable } from \"./observable\";\nimport \"./map\";\nlet o: Observable;\no.map(x => x.toFixed());\n\nThe module name is resolved the same way as module specifiers in import/export.\nSee Modules for more information.\nThen the declarations in an augmentation are merged as if they were declared in the same file as the original.\nHowever, you can't declare new top-level declarations in the augmentation -- just patches to existing declarations.\nGlobal augmentation\nYou can also add declarations to the global scope from inside a module:\n// observable.ts\nexport class Observable {\n    // ... still no implementation ...\n}\n\ndeclare global {\n    interface Array {\n        toObservable(): Observable;\n    }\n}\n\nArray.prototype.toObservable = function () {\n    // ...\n}\n\nGlobal augmentations have the same behavior and limits as module augmentations.\n"},"pages/JSX.html":{"url":"pages/JSX.html","title":"JSX","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nJSX is an embeddable XML-like syntax.\nIt is meant to be transformed into valid JavaScript, though the semantics of that transformation are implementation-specific.\nJSX came to popularity with the React framework, but has since seen other applications as well.\nTypeScript supports embedding, type checking, and compiling JSX directly into JavaScript.\nBasic usage\nIn order to use JSX you must do two things.\n\nName your files with a .tsx extension\nEnable the jsx option\n\nTypeScript ships with three JSX modes: preserve, react, and react-native.\nThese modes only affect the emit stage - type checking is unaffected.\nThe preserve mode will keep the JSX as part of the output to be further consumed by another transform step (e.g. Babel).\nAdditionally the output will have a .jsx file extension.\nThe react mode will emit React.createElement, does not need to go through a JSX transformation before use, and the output will have a .js file extension.\nThe react-native mode is the equivalent of preserve in that it keeps all JSX, but the output will instead have a .js file extension.\n\n\n\nMode\nInput\nOutput\nOutput File Extension\n\n\n\n\npreserve\n\n\n.jsx\n\n\nreact\n\nReact.createElement(\"div\")\n.js\n\n\nreact-native\n\n\n.js\n\n\n\nYou can specify this mode using either the --jsx command line flag or the corresponding option in your tsconfig.json file.\n\nNote: The identifier React is hard-coded, so you must make React available with an uppercase R.\n\nThe as operator\nRecall how to write a type assertion:\nvar foo = bar;\n\nHere we are asserting the variable bar to have the type foo.\nSince TypeScript also uses angle brackets for type assertions, JSX's syntax introduces certain parsing difficulties. As a result, TypeScript disallows angle bracket type assertions in .tsx files.\nTo make up for this loss of functionality in .tsx files, a new type assertion operator has been added: as.\nThe above example can easily be rewritten with the as operator.\nvar foo = bar as foo;\n\nThe as operator is available in both .ts and .tsx files, and is identical in behavior to the other type assertion style.\nType Checking\nIn order to understand type checking with JSX, you must first understand the difference between intrinsic elements and value-based elements.\nGiven a JSX expression , expr may either refer to something intrinsic to the environment (e.g. a div or span in a DOM environment) or to a custom component that you've created.\nThis is important for two reasons:\n\nFor React, intrinsic elements are emitted as strings (React.createElement(\"div\")), whereas a component you've created is not (React.createElement(MyComponent)).\nThe types of the attributes being passed in the JSX element should be looked up differently.\nIntrinsic element attributes should be known intrinsically whereas components will likely want to specify their own set of attributes.\n\nTypeScript uses the same convention that React does for distinguishing between these.\nAn intrinsic element always begins with a lowercase letter, and a value-based element always begins with an uppercase letter.\nIntrinsic elements\nIntrinsic elements are looked up on the special interface JSX.IntrinsicElements.\nBy default, if this interface is not specified, then anything goes and intrinsic elements will not be type checked.\nHowever, if this interface is present, then the name of the intrinsic element is looked up as a property on the JSX.IntrinsicElements interface.\nFor example:\ndeclare namespace JSX {\n    interface IntrinsicElements {\n        foo: any\n    }\n}\n\n; // ok\n; // error\n\nIn the above example,  will work fine but  will result in an error since it has not been specified on JSX.IntrinsicElements.\n\nNote: You can also specify a catch-all string indexer on JSX.IntrinsicElements as follows:\ndeclare namespace JSX {\n   interface IntrinsicElements {\n       [elemName: string]: any;\n   }\n}\n\n\nValue-based elements\nValue based elements are simply looked up by identifiers that are in scope.\nimport MyComponent from \"./myComponent\";\n\n; // ok\n; // error\n\nThere are two ways to define a value-based element:\n\nStateless Functional Component (SFC)\nClass Component\n\nBecause these two types of value-based elements are indistinguishable from each other in JSX expression, we first try to resolve the expression as Stateless Functional Component using overload resolution. If the process successes, then we are done resolving the expression to its declaration. If we fail to resolve as SFC, we will then try to resolve as a class component. If that fails, we will report an error.\nStateless Functional Component\nAs the name suggested, the component is defined as JavaScript function where its first argument is a props object.\nWe enforce that its return type must be assignable to JSX.Element\ninterface FooProp {\n  name: string;\n  X: number;\n  Y: number;\n}\n\ndeclare function AnotherComponent(prop: {name: string});\nfunction ComponentFoo(prop: FooProp) {\n  return ;\n}\n\nconst Button = (prop: {value: string}, context: { color: string }) => \n\nBecause SFC is simply a JavaScript function, we can utilize function overload here as well.\ninterface ClickableProps {\n  children: JSX.Element[] | JSX.Element\n}\n\ninterface HomeProps extends ClickableProps {\n  home: JSX.Element;\n}\n\ninterface SideProps extends ClickableProps {\n  side: JSX.Element | string;\n}\n\nfunction MainButton(prop: HomeProps): JSX.Element;\nfunction MainButton(prop: SideProps): JSX.Element {\n  ...\n}\n\nClass Component\nIt is possible to limit the type of a class component.\nHowever, for this we must introduce two new terms: the element class type and the element instance type.\nGiven , the element class type is the type of Expr.\nSo in the example above, if MyComponent was an ES6 class the class type would be that class.\nIf MyComponent was a factory function, the class type would be that function.\nOnce the class type is established, the instance type is determined by the union of the return types of the class type's call signatures and construct signatures.\nSo again, in the case of an ES6 class, the instance type would be the type of an instance of that class, and in the case of a factory function, it would be the type of the value returned from the function.\nclass MyComponent {\n  render() {}\n}\n\n// use a construct signature\nvar myComponent = new MyComponent();\n\n// element class type => MyComponent\n// element instance type => { render: () => void }\n\nfunction MyFactoryFunction() {\n  return {\n    render: () => {\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// use a call signature\nvar myComponent = MyFactoryFunction();\n\n// element class type => FactoryFunction\n// element instance type => { render: () => void }\n\nThe element instance type is interesting because it must be assignable to JSX.ElementClass or it will result in an error.\nBy default JSX.ElementClass is {}, but it can be augmented to limit the use of JSX to only those types that conform to the proper interface.\ndeclare namespace JSX {\n  interface ElementClass {\n    render: any;\n  }\n}\n\nclass MyComponent {\n  render() {}\n}\nfunction MyFactoryFunction() {\n  return { render: () => {} }\n}\n\n; // ok\n; // ok\n\nclass NotAValidComponent {}\nfunction NotAValidFactoryFunction() {\n  return {};\n}\n\n; // error\n; // error\n\nAttribute type checking\nThe first step to type checking attributes is to determine the element attributes type.\nThis is slightly different between intrinsic and value-based elements.\nFor intrinsic elements, it is the type of the property on JSX.IntrinsicElements\ndeclare namespace JSX {\n  interface IntrinsicElements {\n    foo: { bar?: boolean }\n  }\n}\n\n// element attributes type for 'foo' is '{bar?: boolean}'\n;\n\nFor value-based elements, it is a bit more complex.\nIt is determined by the type of a property on the element instance type that was previously determined.\nWhich property to use is determined by JSX.ElementAttributesProperty.\nIt should be declared with a single property.\nThe name of that property is then used.\ndeclare namespace JSX {\n  interface ElementAttributesProperty {\n    props; // specify the property name to use\n  }\n}\n\nclass MyComponent {\n  // specify the property on the element instance type\n  props: {\n    foo?: string;\n  }\n}\n\n// element attributes type for 'MyComponent' is '{foo?: string}'\n\n\nThe element attribute type is used to type check the attributes in the JSX.\nOptional and required properties are supported.\ndeclare namespace JSX {\n  interface IntrinsicElements {\n    foo: { requiredProp: string; optionalProp?: number }\n  }\n}\n\n; // ok\n; // ok\n; // error, requiredProp is missing\n; // error, requiredProp should be a string\n; // error, unknownProp does not exist\n; // ok, because 'some-unknown-prop' is not a valid identifier\n\n\nNote: If an attribute name is not a valid JS identifier (like a data-* attribute), it is not considered to be an error if it is not found in the element attributes type.\n\nThe spread operator also works:\nvar props = { requiredProp: \"bar\" };\n; // ok\n\nvar badProps = {};\n; // error\n\nChildren Type Checking\nIn 2.3, we introduce type checking of children. children is a property in an element attributes type which we have determined from type checking attributes.\nSimilar to how we use JSX.ElementAttributesProperty to determine the name of props, we use JSX.ElementChildrenAttribute to determine the name of children.\nJSX.ElementChildrenAttribute should be declared with a single property.\ndeclare namespace JSX {\n  interface ElementChildrenAttribute {\n    children: {};  // specify children name to use\n  }\n}\n\nWithout explicitly specify type of children, we will use default type from React typings.\n\n  Hello\n;\n\n\n  Hello\n  World\n;\n\nconst CustomComp = (props) => props.children\n\n  Hello World\n  {\"This is just a JS expression...\" + 1000}\n\n\nYou can specify type of children like any other attribute. This will overwritten default type from React typings.\ninterface PropsType {\n  children: JSX.Element\n  name: string\n}\n\nclass Component extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        this.props.children\n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n\n// OK\n\n  Hello World\n\n\n// Error: children is of type JSX.Element not array of JSX.Element\n\n  Hello World\n  Hello World\n\n\n// Error: children is of type JSX.Element not array of JSX.Element or string.\n\n  Hello\n  World\n\n\nThe JSX result type\nBy default the result of a JSX expression is typed as any.\nYou can customize the type by specifying the JSX.Element interface.\nHowever, it is not possible to retrieve type information about the element, attributes or children of the JSX from this interface.\nIt is a black box.\nEmbedding Expressions\nJSX allows you to embed expressions between tags by surrounding the expressions with curly braces ({ }).\nvar a = \n  {[\"foo\", \"bar\"].map(i => {i / 2})}\n\n\nThe above code will result in an error since you cannot divide a string by a number.\nThe output, when using the preserve option, looks like:\nvar a = \n  {[\"foo\", \"bar\"].map(function (i) { return {i / 2}; })}\n\n\nReact integration\nTo use JSX with React you should use the React typings.\nThese typings define the JSX namespace appropriately for use with React.\n/// \n\ninterface Props {\n  foo: string;\n}\n\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return {this.props.foo}\n  }\n}\n\n; // ok\n; // error\n\n"},"pages/Decorators.html":{"url":"pages/Decorators.html","title":"Decorators","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nWith the introduction of Classes in TypeScript and ES6, there now exist certain scenarios that require additional features to support annotating or modifying classes and class members.\nDecorators provide a way to add both annotations and a meta-programming syntax for class declarations and members.\nDecorators are a stage 2 proposal for JavaScript and are available as an experimental feature of TypeScript.\n\nNOTE  Decorators are an experimental feature that may change in future releases.\n\nTo enable experimental support for decorators, you must enable the experimentalDecorators compiler option either on the command line or in your tsconfig.json:\nCommand Line:\ntsc --target ES5 --experimentalDecorators\n\ntsconfig.json:\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"target\": \"ES5\",\n        \"experimentalDecorators\": true\n    }\n}\n\nDecorators\nA Decorator is a special kind of declaration that can be attached to a class declaration, method, accessor, property, or parameter.\nDecorators use the form @expression, where expression must evaluate to a function that will be called at runtime with information about the decorated declaration.\nFor example, given the decorator @sealed we might write the sealed function as follows:\nfunction sealed(target) {\n    // do something with 'target' ...\n}\n\n\nNOTE  You can see a more detailed example of a decorator in Class Decorators, below.\n\nDecorator Factories\nIf we want to customize how a decorator is applied to a declaration, we can write a decorator factory.\nA Decorator Factory is simply a function that returns the expression that will be called by the decorator at runtime.\nWe can write a decorator factory in the following fashion:\nfunction color(value: string) { // this is the decorator factory\n    return function (target) { // this is the decorator\n        // do something with 'target' and 'value'...\n    }\n}\n\n\nNOTE  You can see a more detailed example of a decorator factory in Method Decorators, below.\n\nDecorator Composition\nMultiple decorators can be applied to a declaration, as in the following examples:\n\nOn a single line:\n@f @g x\n\n\nOn multiple lines:\n@f\n@g\nx\n\n\n\nWhen multiple decorators apply to a single declaration, their evaluation is similar to function composition in mathematics. In this model, when composing functions f and g, the resulting composite (f ∘ g)(x) is equivalent to f(g(x)).\nAs such, the following steps are performed when evaluating multiple decorators on a single declaration in TypeScript:\n\nThe expressions for each decorator are evaluated top-to-bottom.\nThe results are then called as functions from bottom-to-top.\n\nIf we were to use decorator factories, we can observe this evaluation order with the following example:\nfunction f() {\n    console.log(\"f(): evaluated\");\n    return function (target, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {\n        console.log(\"f(): called\");\n    }\n}\n\nfunction g() {\n    console.log(\"g(): evaluated\");\n    return function (target, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {\n        console.log(\"g(): called\");\n    }\n}\n\nclass C {\n    @f()\n    @g()\n    method() {}\n}\n\nWhich would print this output to the console:\nf(): evaluated\ng(): evaluated\ng(): called\nf(): called\n\nDecorator Evaluation\nThere is a well defined order to how decorators applied to various declarations inside of a class are applied:\n\nParameter Decorators, followed by Method, Accessor, or Property Decorators are applied for each instance member.\nParameter Decorators, followed by Method, Accessor, or Property Decorators are applied for each static member.\nParameter Decorators are applied for the constructor.\nClass Decorators are applied for the class.\n\nClass Decorators\nA Class Decorator is declared just before a class declaration.\nThe class decorator is applied to the constructor of the class and can be used to observe, modify, or replace a class definition.\nA class decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, or in any other ambient context (such as on a declare class).\nThe expression for the class decorator will be called as a function at runtime, with the constructor of the decorated class as its only argument.\nIf the class decorator returns a value, it will replace the class declaration with the provided constructor function.\n\nNOTE  Should you chose to return a new constructor function, you must take care to maintain the original prototype.\nThe logic that applies decorators at runtime will not do this for you.\n\nThe following is an example of a class decorator (@sealed) applied to the Greeter class:\n@sealed\nclass Greeter {\n    greeting: string;\n    constructor(message: string) {\n        this.greeting = message;\n    }\n    greet() {\n        return \"Hello, \" + this.greeting;\n    }\n}\n\nWe can define the @sealed decorator using the following function declaration:\nfunction sealed(constructor: Function) {\n    Object.seal(constructor);\n    Object.seal(constructor.prototype);\n}\n\nWhen @sealed is executed, it will seal both the constructor and its prototype.\nNext we have an example of how to override the constructor.\nfunction classDecorator(constructor:T) {\n    return class extends constructor {\n        newProperty = \"new property\";\n        hello = \"override\";\n    }\n}\n\n@classDecorator\nclass Greeter {\n    property = \"property\";\n    hello: string;\n    constructor(m: string) {\n        this.hello = m;\n    }\n}\n\nconsole.log(new Greeter(\"world\"));\n\nMethod Decorators\nA Method Decorator is declared just before a method declaration.\nThe decorator is applied to the Property Descriptor for the method, and can be used to observe, modify, or replace a method definition.\nA method decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, on an overload, or in any other ambient context (such as in a declare class).\nThe expression for the method decorator will be called as a function at runtime, with the following three arguments:\n\nEither the constructor function of the class for a static member, or the prototype of the class for an instance member.\nThe name of the member.\nThe Property Descriptor for the member.\n\n\nNOTE  The Property Descriptor will be undefined if your script target is less than ES5.\n\nIf the method decorator returns a value, it will be used as the Property Descriptor for the method.\n\nNOTE  The return value is ignored if your script target is less than ES5.\n\nThe following is an example of a method decorator (@enumerable) applied to a method on the Greeter class:\nclass Greeter {\n    greeting: string;\n    constructor(message: string) {\n        this.greeting = message;\n    }\n\n    @enumerable(false)\n    greet() {\n        return \"Hello, \" + this.greeting;\n    }\n}\n\nWe can define the @enumerable decorator using the following function declaration:\nfunction enumerable(value: boolean) {\n    return function (target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {\n        descriptor.enumerable = value;\n    };\n}\n\nThe @enumerable(false) decorator here is a decorator factory.\nWhen the @enumerable(false) decorator is called, it modifies the enumerable property of the property descriptor.\nAccessor Decorators\nAn Accessor Decorator is declared just before an accessor declaration.\nThe accessor decorator is applied to the Property Descriptor for the accessor and can be used to observe, modify, or replace an accessor's definitions.\nAn accessor decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, or in any other ambient context (such as in a declare class).\n\nNOTE  TypeScript disallows decorating both the get and set accessor for a single member.\nInstead, all decorators for the member must be applied to the first accessor specified in document order.\nThis is because decorators apply to a Property Descriptor, which combines both the get and set accessor, not each declaration separately.\n\nThe expression for the accessor decorator will be called as a function at runtime, with the following three arguments:\n\nEither the constructor function of the class for a static member, or the prototype of the class for an instance member.\nThe name of the member.\nThe Property Descriptor for the member.\n\n\nNOTE  The Property Descriptor will be undefined if your script target is less than ES5.\n\nIf the accessor decorator returns a value, it will be used as the Property Descriptor for the member.\n\nNOTE  The return value is ignored if your script target is less than ES5.\n\nThe following is an example of an accessor decorator (@configurable) applied to a member of the Point class:\nclass Point {\n    private _x: number;\n    private _y: number;\n    constructor(x: number, y: number) {\n        this._x = x;\n        this._y = y;\n    }\n\n    @configurable(false)\n    get x() { return this._x; }\n\n    @configurable(false)\n    get y() { return this._y; }\n}\n\nWe can define the @configurable decorator using the following function declaration:\nfunction configurable(value: boolean) {\n    return function (target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {\n        descriptor.configurable = value;\n    };\n}\n\nProperty Decorators\nA Property Decorator is declared just before a property declaration.\nA property decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, or in any other ambient context (such as in a declare class).\nThe expression for the property decorator will be called as a function at runtime, with the following two arguments:\n\nEither the constructor function of the class for a static member, or the prototype of the class for an instance member.\nThe name of the member.\n\n\nNOTE  A Property Descriptor is not provided as an argument to a property decorator due to how property decorators are initialized in TypeScript.\nThis is because there is currently no mechanism to describe an instance property when defining members of a prototype, and no way to observe or modify the initializer for a property. The return value is ignored too.\nAs such, a property decorator can only be used to observe that a property of a specific name has been declared for a class.\n\nWe can use this information to record metadata about the property, as in the following example:\nclass Greeter {\n    @format(\"Hello, %s\")\n    greeting: string;\n\n    constructor(message: string) {\n        this.greeting = message;\n    }\n    greet() {\n        let formatString = getFormat(this, \"greeting\");\n        return formatString.replace(\"%s\", this.greeting);\n    }\n}\n\nWe can then define the @format decorator and getFormat functions using the following function declarations:\nimport \"reflect-metadata\";\n\nconst formatMetadataKey = Symbol(\"format\");\n\nfunction format(formatString: string) {\n    return Reflect.metadata(formatMetadataKey, formatString);\n}\n\nfunction getFormat(target: any, propertyKey: string) {\n    return Reflect.getMetadata(formatMetadataKey, target, propertyKey);\n}\n\nThe @format(\"Hello, %s\") decorator here is a decorator factory.\nWhen @format(\"Hello, %s\") is called, it adds a metadata entry for the property using the Reflect.metadata function from the reflect-metadata library.\nWhen getFormat is called, it reads the metadata value for the format.\n\nNOTE  This example requires the reflect-metadata library.\nSee Metadata for more information about the reflect-metadata library.\n\nParameter Decorators\nA Parameter Decorator is declared just before a parameter declaration.\nThe parameter decorator is applied to the function for a class constructor or method declaration.\nA parameter decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, an overload, or in any other ambient context (such as in a declare class).\nThe expression for the parameter decorator will be called as a function at runtime, with the following three arguments:\n\nEither the constructor function of the class for a static member, or the prototype of the class for an instance member.\nThe name of the member.\nThe ordinal index of the parameter in the function's parameter list.\n\n\nNOTE  A parameter decorator can only be used to observe that a parameter has been declared on a method.\n\nThe return value of the parameter decorator is ignored.\nThe following is an example of a parameter decorator (@required) applied to parameter of a member of the Greeter class:\nclass Greeter {\n    greeting: string;\n\n    constructor(message: string) {\n        this.greeting = message;\n    }\n\n    @validate\n    greet(@required name: string) {\n        return \"Hello \" + name + \", \" + this.greeting;\n    }\n}\n\nWe can then define the @required and @validate decorators using the following function declarations:\nimport \"reflect-metadata\";\n\nconst requiredMetadataKey = Symbol(\"required\");\n\nfunction required(target: Object, propertyKey: string | symbol, parameterIndex: number) {\n    let existingRequiredParameters: number[] = Reflect.getOwnMetadata(requiredMetadataKey, target, propertyKey) || [];\n    existingRequiredParameters.push(parameterIndex);\n    Reflect.defineMetadata(requiredMetadataKey, existingRequiredParameters, target, propertyKey);\n}\n\nfunction validate(target: any, propertyName: string, descriptor: TypedPropertyDescriptor) {\n    let method = descriptor.value;\n    descriptor.value = function () {\n        let requiredParameters: number[] = Reflect.getOwnMetadata(requiredMetadataKey, target, propertyName);\n        if (requiredParameters) {\n            for (let parameterIndex of requiredParameters) {\n                if (parameterIndex >= arguments.length || arguments[parameterIndex] === undefined) {\n                    throw new Error(\"Missing required argument.\");\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        return method.apply(this, arguments);\n    }\n}\n\nThe @required decorator adds a metadata entry that marks the parameter as required.\nThe @validate decorator then wraps the existing greet method in a function that validates the arguments before invoking the original method.\n\nNOTE  This example requires the reflect-metadata library.\nSee Metadata for more information about the reflect-metadata library.\n\nMetadata\nSome examples use the reflect-metadata library which adds a polyfill for an experimental metadata API.\nThis library is not yet part of the ECMAScript (JavaScript) standard.\nHowever, once decorators are officially adopted as part of the ECMAScript standard these extensions will be proposed for adoption.\nYou can install this library via npm:\nnpm i reflect-metadata --save\n\nTypeScript includes experimental support for emitting certain types of metadata for declarations that have decorators.\nTo enable this experimental support, you must set the emitDecoratorMetadata compiler option either on the command line or in your tsconfig.json:\nCommand Line:\ntsc --target ES5 --experimentalDecorators --emitDecoratorMetadata\n\ntsconfig.json:\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"target\": \"ES5\",\n        \"experimentalDecorators\": true,\n        \"emitDecoratorMetadata\": true\n    }\n}\n\nWhen enabled, as long as the reflect-metadata library has been imported, additional design-time type information will be exposed at runtime.\nWe can see this in action in the following example:\nimport \"reflect-metadata\";\n\nclass Point {\n    x: number;\n    y: number;\n}\n\nclass Line {\n    private _p0: Point;\n    private _p1: Point;\n\n    @validate\n    set p0(value: Point) { this._p0 = value; }\n    get p0() { return this._p0; }\n\n    @validate\n    set p1(value: Point) { this._p1 = value; }\n    get p1() { return this._p1; }\n}\n\nfunction validate(target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: TypedPropertyDescriptor) {\n    let set = descriptor.set;\n    descriptor.set = function (value: T) {\n        let type = Reflect.getMetadata(\"design:type\", target, propertyKey);\n        if (!(value instanceof type)) {\n            throw new TypeError(\"Invalid type.\");\n        }\n        set(value);\n    }\n}\n\nThe TypeScript compiler will inject design-time type information using the @Reflect.metadata decorator.\nYou could consider it the equivalent of the following TypeScript:\nclass Line {\n    private _p0: Point;\n    private _p1: Point;\n\n    @validate\n    @Reflect.metadata(\"design:type\", Point)\n    set p0(value: Point) { this._p0 = value; }\n    get p0() { return this._p0; }\n\n    @validate\n    @Reflect.metadata(\"design:type\", Point)\n    set p1(value: Point) { this._p1 = value; }\n    get p1() { return this._p1; }\n}\n\n\nNOTE  Decorator metadata is an experimental feature and may introduce breaking changes in future releases.\n\n"},"pages/Mixins.html":{"url":"pages/Mixins.html","title":"Mixins","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nAlong with traditional OO hierarchies, another popular way of building up classes from reusable components is to build them by combining simpler partial classes.\nYou may be familiar with the idea of mixins or traits for languages like

sample starts with the two classes that will act as our mixins.\nYou can see each one is focused on a particular activity or capability.\nWe'll later mix these together to form a new class from both capabilities.\n// Disposable Mixin\nclass Disposable {\n    isDisposed: boolean;\n    dispose() {\n        this.isDisposed = true;\n    }\n\n}\n\n// Activatable Mixin\nclass Activatable {\n    isActive: boolean;\n    activate() {\n        this.isActive = true;\n    }\n    deactivate() {\n        this.isActive = false;\n    }\n}\n\nNext, we'll create the class that will handle the combination of the two mixins.\nLet's look at this in more detail to see how it does this:\nclass SmartObject implements Disposable, Activatable {\n\nThe first thing you may notice in the above is that instead of using extends, we use implements.\nThis treats the classes as interfaces, and only uses the types behind Disposable and Activatable rather than the implementation.\nThis means that we'll have to provide the implementation in class.\nExcept, that's exactly what we want to avoid by using mixins.\nTo satisfy this requirement, we create stand-in properties and their types for the members that will come from our mixins.\nThis satisfies the compiler that these members will be available at runtime.\nThis lets us still get the benefit of the mixins, albeit with some bookkeeping overhead.\n// Disposable\nisDisposed: boolean = false;\ndispose: () => void;\n// Activatable\nisActive: boolean = false;\nactivate: () => void;\ndeactivate: () => void;\n\nFinally, we mix our mixins into the class, creating the full implementation.\napplyMixins(SmartObject, [Disposable, Activatable]);\n\nLastly, we create a helper function that will do the mixing for us.\nThis will run through the properties of each of the mixins and copy them over to the target of the mixins, filling out the stand-in properties with their implementations.\nfunction applyMixins(derivedCtor: any, baseCtors: any[]) {\n    baseCtors.forEach(baseCtor => {\n        Object.getOwnPropertyNames(baseCtor.prototype).forEach(name => {\n            derivedCtor.prototype[name] = baseCtor.prototype[name];\n

For instance:\nclass C {\n    constructor() {\n        /** @type {number | undefined} */\n    this.prop = undefined;\n    }\n}\n\n\nlet c = new C();\nc.prop = 0;         // OK\nc.prop = \"string\";  // Error: string is not assignable to number|undefined\n\nIf properties are never set in the class body, they are considered unknown. If your class has properties that are only read from, consider adding an initialization in the constructor to undefined, e.g. this.prop = undefined;.\nCommonJS module input support\nIn a .js files CommonJS module format is allowed as an input module format. Assignments to exports, and module.exports are recognized as export declarations. Similarly, require function calls are recognized as module imports. For example:\n// import module \"fs\"\nconst fs = require(\"fs\");\n\n\n// export function readFile\nmodule.exports.readFile = function(f) {\n    return fs.readFileSync(f);    \n}\n\nObject literals are open-ended\nBy default object literals in variable declarations provide the type of a declaration. No new members can be added that were not specified in the original initialization. This rule is relaxed in a .js file; object literals have an open-ended type, allowing adding and looking up properties that were not defined originally. For instance:\nvar obj = { a: 1 };\nobj.b = 2;  // Allowed\n\nObject literals get a default index signature [x:string]: any that allows them to be treated as open maps instead of closed objects.\nSimilar to other special JS checking behaviors, this behavior can be changed by specifying a JSDoc type for the variable. For example:\n/** @type {{a: number}} */\nvar obj = { a: 1 };\nobj.b = 2;  // Error, type {a: number} does not have property b\n\nFunction parameters are optional by default\nSince there is no way to specify optionality on parameters in JS (without specifying a default value), all function parameters in .js file are considered optional. Calls with fewer arguments are allowed. \nIt is important to note that it is an error to call a function with too many arguments.\nFor instance:\nfunction bar(a, b){\n    console.log(a + \" \" + b);\n}\n\nbar(1);       // OK, second argument considered optional\nbar(1, 2);\nbar(1, 2, 3); // Error, too many arguments\n\nJSDoc annotated functions are excluded from this rule. Use JSDoc optional parameter syntax to express optionality. e.g.:\n/**\n * @param {string} [somebody] - Somebody's name.\n */\nfunction sayHello(somebody) {\n    if (!somebody) {\n        somebody = 'John Doe';\n    }\n    alert('Hello ' + somebody);\n}\n\nsayHello();\n\nVar-args parameter declaration inferred from use of arguments\nA function whose body has a reference to the arguments reference is implicitly considered to have a var-arg parameter (i.e. (...arg: any[]) => any). Use JSDoc var-arg syntax to specify the type of the arguments.\nUnspecified type parameters default to any\nAn unspecified generic type parameter defaults to any. There are few places where this happens:\nIn extends clause:\nFor instance, React.Component is defined to have two generic type parameters, Props and State. \nIn a .js file, there is no legal way to specify these in the extends clause. By default the type arguments will be any:\nimport { Component } from \"react\";\n\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n    render() {\n       this.props.b; // Allowed, since this.props is of type any\n    }\n}\n\nUse JSDoc @augments to specify the types explicitly. for instance:\nimport { Component } from \"react\";\n\n/**\n * @augments {Component}\n */\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n    render() {\n        this.props.b; // Error: b does not exist on {a:number}\n    }\n}\n\nIn JSDoc references\nAn unspecified generic type argument in JSDoc defaults to any:\n/** @type{Array} */\nvar x = [];\n\nx.push(1);        // OK\nx.push(\"string\"); // OK, x is of type Array\n\n\n/** @type{Array.} */\nvar y = [];\n\ny.push(1);        // OK\ny.push(\"string\"); // Error, string is not assignable to number\n\nIn function calls\nA call to generic functions uses arguments to infer the generic type parameters. Sometimes this process fails to infer any types, mainly because of lack on inference sources; in these cases, the generic type parameters will default to any. For example:\nvar p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { reject() });\n\np; // Promise;\n\n"},"pages/declaration files/Introduction.html":{"url":"pages/declaration

namespaces.\nSections\nThe guide is broken down into the following sections.\nLibrary Structures\nThe Library Structures guide helps you understand common library formats and how to write a correct declaration file for each format.\nIf you're editing an existing file, you probably don't need to read this section.\nAuthors of new declaration files must read this section to properly understand how the format of the library influences the writing of the declaration file.\nBy Example\nMany times, we are faced with writing a declaration file when we only have examples of the underlying library to

Structures.html":{"url":"pages/declaration files/Library Structures.html","title":"Library Structures","keywords":"","body":"Overview\nBroadly speaking, the way you structure your declaration file depends on how the library is consumed.\nThere are many ways of offering a library for consumption in JavaScript, and you'll need to write your declaration file to match it.\nThis guide covers how to identify common library patterns, and how to write declaration files which correspond to that pattern.\nEach type of major library structuring pattern has a corresponding file in the Templates section.\nYou can start with these templates to help you get going faster.\nIdentifying Kinds of Libraries\nFirst, we'll review the kinds of libraries TypeScript declaration files can represent.\nWe'll briefly show how each kind of library is used, how it is written, and list some example libraries from the real world.\nIdentifying the structure of a library is the first step in writing its declaration file.\nWe'll give hints on how to identify structure both based on its usage and its code.\nDepending on the library's documentation and organization, one might be easier than the other.\nWe recommend using whichever is more comfortable to you.\nGlobal Libraries\nA global library is one that can be accessed from the global scope (i.e. without using any form of import).\nMany libraries simply expose one or more global variables for use.\nFor example, if you were using jQuery, the $ variable can be used by simply referring to it:\n$(() => { console.log('hello!'); } );\n\nYou'll usually see guidance in the documentation of a global library of how to use the library in an HTML script tag:\n\n\nToday, most popular globally-accessible libraries are actually written as UMD libraries (see below).\nUMD library documentation is hard to distinguish from global library documentation.\nBefore writing a global declaration file, make sure the library isn't actually UMD.\nIdentifying a Global Library from Code\nGlobal library code is usually extremely simple.\nA global \"Hello, world\" library might look like this:\nfunction createGreeting(s) {\n    return \"Hello, \" + s;\n}\n\nor like this:\nwindow.createGreeting = function(s) {\n    return \"Hello, \" + s;\n}\n\nWhen looking at the code of a global library, you'll usually see:\n\nTop-level var statements or function declarations\nOne or more assignments to window.someName\nAssumptions that DOM primitives like document or window exist\n\nYou won't see:\n\nChecks for, or usage of, module loaders like require or define\nCommonJS/Node.js-style imports of the form var fs = require(\"fs\");\nCalls to define(...)\nDocumentation describing how to require or import the library\n\nExamples of Global Libraries\nBecause it's usually easy to turn a global library into a UMD library, very few popular libraries are still written in the global style.\nHowever, libraries that are small and require the DOM (or have no dependencies) may still be global.\nGlobal Library Template\nThe template file global.d.ts defines an example library myLib.\nBe sure to read the \"Preventing Name Conflicts\" footnote.\nModular Libraries\nSome libraries only work in a module loader environment.\nFor example, because express only works in Node.js and must be loaded using the CommonJS require function.\nECMAScript 2015 (also known as ES2015, ECMAScript 6, and ES6), CommonJS, and RequireJS have similar notions of importing a module.\nIn JavaScript CommonJS (Node.js), for example, you would write\nvar fs = require(\"fs\");\n\nIn TypeScript or ES6, the import keyword serves the same purpose:\nimport fs = require(\"fs\");\n\nYou'll typically see modular libraries include one of these lines in their documentation:\nvar someLib = require('someLib');\n\nor\ndefine(..., ['someLib'], function(someLib) {\n\n});\n\nAs with global modules, you might see these examples in the documentation of a UMD module, so be sure to check the code or documentation.\nIdentifying a Module Library from Code\nModular libraries will typically have at least some of the following:\n\nUnconditional calls to require or define\nDeclarations like import * as a from 'b'; or export c;\nAssignments to exports or module.exports\n\nThey will rarely have:\n\nAssignments to properties of window or global\n\nExamples of Modular Libraries\nMany popular Node.js libraries are in the module family, such as express, gulp, and request.\nUMD\nA UMD module is one that can either be used as module (through an import), or as a global (when run in an environment without a module loader).\nMany popular libraries, such as Moment.js, are written this way.\nFor example, in Node.js or using RequireJS, you would write:\nimport moment = require(\"moment\");\nconsole.log(moment.format());\n\nwhereas in a vanilla browser environment you would write:\nconsole.log(moment.format());\n\nIdentifying a UMD library\nUMD modules check for the existence of a module loader environment.\nThis is an easy-to-spot pattern that looks something like this:\n(function (root, factory) {\n    if (typeof define === \"function\" && define.amd) {\n        define([\"libName\"], factory);\n    } else if (typeof module === \"object\" && module.exports) {\n        module.exports = factory(require(\"libName\"));\n    } else {\n        root.returnExports = factory(root.libName);\n    }\n}(this, function (b) {\n\nIf you see tests for typeof define, typeof window, or typeof module in the code of a library, especially at the top of the file, it's almost always a UMD library.\nDocumentation for UMD libraries will also often demonstrate a \"Using in Node.js\" example showing require,\n  and a \"Using in the browser\" example showing using a  tag to load the script.\nExamples of UMD libraries\nMost popular libraries are now available as UMD packages.\nExamples include jQuery, Moment.js, lodash, and many more.\nTemplate\nThere are three templates available for modules,\n  module.d.ts, module-class.d.ts and module-function.d.ts.\nUse module-function.d.ts if your module can be called like a function:\nvar x = require(\"foo\");\n// Note: calling 'x' as a function\nvar y = x(42);\n\nBe sure to read the footnote \"The Impact of ES6 on Module Call Signatures\"\nUse module-class.d.ts if your module can be constructed using new:\nvar x = require(\"bar\");\n// Note: using 'new' operator on the imported variable\nvar y = new x(\"hello\");\n\nThe same footnote applies to these modules.\nIf your module is not callable or constructable, use the module.d.ts file.\nModule Plugin or UMD Plugin\nA module plugin changes the shape of another module (either UMD or module).\nFor example, in Moment.js, moment-range adds a new range method to the moment object.\nFor the purposes of writing a declaration file, you'll write the same code whether the module being changed is a plain module or UMD module.\nTemplate\nUse the module-plugin.d.ts template.\nGlobal Plugin\nA global plugin is global code that changes the shape of some global.\nAs with global-modifying modules, these raise the possibility of runtime conflict.\nFor example, some libraries add new functions to Array.prototype or String.prototype.\nIdentifying global plugins\nGlobal plugins are generally easy to identify from their documentation.\nYou'll see examples that look like this:\nvar x = \"hello, world\";\n// Creates new methods on built-in types\nconsole.log(x.startsWithHello());\n\nvar y = [1, 2, 3];\n// Creates new methods on built-in types\nconsole.log(y.reverseAndSort());\n\nTemplate\nUse the global-plugin.d.ts template.\nGlobal-modifying Modules\nA global-modifying module alters existing values in the global scope when they are imported.\nFor example, there might exist a library which adds new members to String.prototype when imported.\nThis pattern is somewhat dangerous due to the possibility of runtime conflicts,\n  but we can still write a declaration file for it.\nIdentifying global-modifying modules\nGlobal-modifying modules are generally easy to identify from their documentation.\nIn general, they're similar to global plugins, but need a require call to activate their effects.\nYou might see documentation like this:\n// 'require' call that doesn't use its return value\nvar unused = require(\"magic-string-time\");\n/* or */\nrequire(\"magic-string-time\");\n\nvar x = \"hello, world\";\n// Creates new methods on built-in types\nconsole.log(x.startsWithHello());\n\nvar y = [1, 2, 3];\n// Creates new methods on built-in types\nconsole.log(y.reverseAndSort());\n\nTemplate\nUse the global-modifying-module.d.ts template.\nConsuming Dependencies\nThere are several kinds of dependencies you might have.\nDependencies on Global Libraries\nIf your library depends on a global library, use a ///  directive:\n/// \n\nfunction getThing(): someLib.thing;\n\nDependencies on Modules\nIf your library depends on a module, use an import statement:\nimport * as moment from \"moment\";\n\nfunction getThing(): moment;\n\nDependencies on UMD libraries\nFrom a Global Library\nIf your global library depends on a UMD module, use a ///  directive:\n/// \n\nfunction getThing(): moment;\n\nFrom a Module or UMD Library\nIf your module or UMD library depends on a UMD library, use an import statement:\nimport * as someLib from 'someLib';\n\nDo not use a ///  directive to declare a dependency to a UMD library!\nFootnotes\nPreventing Name Conflicts\nNote that it's possible to define many types in the global scope when writing a global declaration file.\nWe strongly discourage this as it leads to possible unresolvable name conflicts when many declaration files are in a project.\nA simple rule to follow is to only declare types namespaced by whatever global variable the library defines.\nFor example, if the library defines the global value 'cats', you should write\ndeclare namespace cats {\n    interface KittySettings { }\n}\n\nBut not\n// at top-level\ninterface CatsKittySettings { }\n\nThis guidance also ensures that the library can be transitioned to UMD without breaking declaration file users.\nThe Impact of ES6 on Module Plugins\nSome plugins add or modify top-level exports on existing modules.\nWhile this is legal in CommonJS and other loaders, ES6 modules are considered immutable and this pattern will not be possible.\nBecause TypeScript is loader-agnostic, there is no compile-time enforcement of this policy, but developers intending to transition to an ES6 module loader should be aware of this.\nThe Impact of ES6 on Module Call Signatures\nMany popular libraries, such as Express, expose themselves as a callable function when imported.\nFor example, the typical Express usage looks like this:\nimport exp = require(\"express\");\nvar app = exp();\n\nIn ES6 module loaders, the top-level object (here imported as exp) can only have properties;\n  the top-level module object is never callable.\nThe most common solution here is to define a default export for a callable/constructable object;\n  some module loader shims will automatically detect this situation and replace the top-level object with the default export.\n"},"pages/declaration files/By Example.html":{"url":"pages/declaration files/By Example.html","title":"By Example","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nThe purpose of this guide is to

something else\n    k.doSomething(); // error, but would be OK if the return type had been 'any'\n}\n\nOptional Parameters in Callbacks\nDon't use optional parameters in callbacks unless you really mean it:\n/* WRONG */\ninterface Fetcher {\n    getObject(done: (data: any, elapsedTime?: number) => void): void;\n}\n\nThis has a very specific meaning: the done callback might be invoked with 1 argument or might be invoked with 2 arguments.\nThe author probably intended to say that the callback might not care about the elapsedTime parameter,\n  but there's no need to make the parameter optional to accomplish this --\n  it's always legal to provide a callback that accepts fewer arguments.\nDo write callback parameters as non-optional:\n/* OK */\ninterface Fetcher {\n    getObject(done: (data: any, elapsedTime: number) => void): void;\n}\n\nOverloads and Callbacks\nDon't write separate overloads that differ only on callback arity:\n/* WRONG */\ndeclare function

OK */\ndeclare function beforeAll(action: (done: DoneFn) => void, timeout?: number): void;\n\nWhy: It's always legal for a callback to disregard a parameter, so there's no need for the shorter overload.\nProviding a shorter callback first allows incorrectly-typed functions to be passed in because they match the first overload.\nFunction Overloads\nOrdering\nDon't put more general overloads before more specific overloads:\n/* WRONG */\ndeclare function fn(x: any): any;\ndeclare function fn(x: HTMLElement): number;\ndeclare function fn(x: HTMLDivElement): string;\n\nvar myElem:

string;\ndeclare function fn(x: HTMLElement): number;\ndeclare function fn(x: any): any;\n\nvar myElem: HTMLDivElement;\nvar x = fn(myElem); // x: string, :)\n\nWhy: TypeScript chooses the first matching overload when resolving function calls.\nWhen an earlier overload is \"more general\" than a later one, the later one is effectively hidden and cannot be called.\nUse Optional Parameters\nDon't write several overloads that differ only in trailing parameters:\n/* WRONG */\ninterface Example {\n    diff(one: string): number;\n    diff(one: string, two: string): number;\n    diff(one: string, two: string, three: boolean): number;\n}\n\nDo use optional parameters whenever possible:\n/* OK */\ninterface Example {\n    diff(one: string, two?: string, three?: boolean): number;\n}\n\nNote that this collapsing should only occur when all overloads have the same return type.\nWhy: This is important for two reasons.\nTypeScript resolves signature compatibility by seeing if any signature of the target can be invoked with the arguments of the source,\n  and extraneous arguments are allowed.\nThis code, for example, exposes a bug only when the signature is correctly written using optional parameters:\nfunction fn(x: (a: string, b: number, c: number) => void) { }\nvar x: Example;\n// When written with overloads, OK -- used first overload\n// When written with optionals, correctly an error\nfn(x.diff);\n\nThe second reason is when a consumer uses the \"strict null checking\" feature of TypeScript.\nBecause unspecified parameters appear as undefined in JavaScript, it's usually fine to pass an explicit undefined to a function with optional arguments.\nThis code, for example, should be OK under strict nulls:\nvar x: Example;\n// When written with overloads, incorrectly an error because of passing 'undefined' to 'string'\n// When written with optionals, correctly OK\nx.diff(\"something\", true ? undefined : \"hour\");\n\nUse Union Types\nDon't write overloads that differ by type in only one argument position:\n/* WRONG */\ninterface Moment {\n    utcOffset(): number;\n    utcOffset(b: number): Moment;\n    utcOffset(b: string): Moment;\n}\n\nDo use union types whenever possible:\n/* OK */\ninterface Moment {\n    utcOffset(): number;\n    utcOffset(b: number|string): Moment;\n}\n\nNote that we didn't make b optional here because the return types of the signatures differ.\nWhy: This is important for people who are \"passing through\" a value to your function:\nfunction fn(x: string): void;\nfunction fn(x: number): void;\nfunction fn(x: number|string) {\n    // When written with separate overloads, incorrectly an error\n    // When written with union types, correctly OK\n    return moment().utcOffset(x);\n}\n\n"},"pages/declaration files/Deep Dive.html":{"url":"pages/declaration files/Deep Dive.html","title":"Deep Dive","keywords":"","body":"Definition File Theory: A Deep Dive\nStructuring modules to give the exact API shape you want can be tricky.\nFor example, we might want a module that can be invoked with or without new to produce different types,\n  has a variety of named types exposed in a hierarchy,\n  and has some properties on the module object as well.\nBy reading this guide, you'll have the tools to write complex definition files that expose a friendly API surface.\nThis guide focuses on module (or UMD) libraries because the options here are more varied.\nKey Concepts\nYou can fully understand how to make any shape of definition\n  by understanding some key concepts of how TypeScript works.\nTypes\nIf you're reading this guide, you probably already roughly know what a type in TypeScript is.\nTo be more explicit, though, a type is introduced with:\n\nA type alias declaration (type sn = number | string;)\nAn interface declaration (interface I { x: number[]; })\nA class declaration (class C { })\nAn enum declaration (enum E { A, B, C })\nAn import declaration which refers to a type\n\nEach of these declaration forms creates a new type name.\nValues\nAs with types, you probably already understand what a value is.\nValues are runtime names that we can reference in expressions.\nFor example let x = 5; creates a value called x.\nAgain, being explicit, the following things create values:\n\nlet, const, and var declarations\nA namespace or module declaration which contains a value\nAn enum declaration\nA class declaration\nAn import declaration which refers to a value\nA function declaration\n\nNamespaces\nTypes can exist in namespaces.\nFor example, if we have the declaration let x: A.B.C,\n  we say that the type C comes from the A.B namespace.\nThis distinction is subtle and important -- here, A.B is not necessarily a type or a value.\nSimple Combinations: One name, multiple meanings\nGiven a name A, we might find up to three different meanings for A: a type, a value or a namespace.\nHow the name is interpreted depends on the context in which it is used.\nFor example, in the declaration let m: A.A = A;,\n  A is used first as a namespace, then as a type name, then as a value.\nThese meanings might end up referring to entirely different declarations!\nThis may seem confusing, but it's actually very convenient as long as we don't excessively overload things.\nLet's look at some useful aspects of this combining behavior.\nBuilt-in Combinations\nAstute readers will notice that, for example, class appeared in both the type and value lists.\nThe declaration class C { } creates two things:\n  a type C which refers to the instance shape of the class,\n  and a value C which refers to the constructor function of the class.\nEnum declarations behave similarly.\nUser Combinations\nLet's say we wrote a module file foo.d.ts:\nexport var SomeVar: { a: SomeType };\nexport interface SomeType {\n  count: number;\n}\n\nThen consumed it:\nimport * as foo from './foo';\nlet x: foo.SomeType = foo.SomeVar.a;\nconsole.log(x.count);\n\nThis works well enough, but we might imagine that SomeType and SomeVar were very closely related\n  such that you'd like them to have the same name.\nWe can use combining to present these two different objects (the value and the type) under the same name Bar:\nexport var Bar: { a: Bar };\nexport interface Bar {\n  count: number;\n}\n\nThis presents a very good opportunity for destructuring in the consuming code:\nimport { Bar } from './foo';\nlet x: Bar = Bar.a;\nconsole.log(x.count);\n\nAgain, we've used Bar as both a type and a value here.\nNote that we didn't have to declare the Bar value as being of the Bar type -- they're independent.\nAdvanced Combinations\nSome kinds of declarations can be combined across multiple declarations.\nFor example, class C { } and interface C { } can co-exist and both contribute properties to the C types.\nThis is legal as long as it does not create a conflict.\nA general rule of thumb is that values always conflict with other values of the same name unless they are declared as namespaces,\n  types will conflict if they are declared with a type alias declaration (type s = string),\n  and namespaces never conflict.\nLet's see how this can be used.\nAdding using an interface\nWe can add additional members to an interface with another interface declaration:\ninterface Foo {\n  x: number;\n}\n// ... elsewhere ...\ninterface Foo {\n  y: number;\n}\nlet a: Foo = ...;\nconsole.log(a.x + a.y); // OK\n\nThis also works with classes:\nclass Foo {\n  x: number;\n}\n// ... elsewhere ...\ninterface Foo {\n  y: number;\n}\nlet a: Foo = ...;\nconsole.log(a.x + a.y); // OK\n\nNote that we cannot add to type aliases (type s = string;) using an interface.\nAdding using a namespace\nA namespace declaration can be used to add new types, values, and namespaces in any way which does not create a conflict.\nFor example, we can add a static member to a class:\nclass C {\n}\n// ... elsewhere ...\nnamespace C {\n  export let x: number;\n}\nlet y = C.x; // OK\n\nNote that in this example, we added a value to the static side of C (its constructor function).\nThis is because we added a value, and the container for all values is another value\n  (types are contained by namespaces, and namespaces are contained by other namespaces).\nWe could also add a namespaced type to a class:\nclass C {\n}\n// ... elsewhere ...\nnamespace C {\n  export interface D { }\n}\nlet y: C.D; // OK\n\nIn this example, there wasn't a namespace C until we wrote the namespace declaration for it.\nThe meaning C as a namespace doesn't conflict with the value or type meanings of C created by the class.\nFinally, we could perform many different merges using namespace declarations.\nThis isn't a particularly realistic example, but shows all sorts of interesting behavior:\nnamespace X {\n  export interface Y { }\n  export class Z { }\n}\n\n// ... elsewhere ...\nnamespace X {\n  export var Y: number;\n  export namespace Z {\n    export class C { }\n  }\n}\ntype X = string;\n\nIn this example, the first block creates the following name meanings:\n\nA value X (because the namespace declaration contains a value, Z)\nA namespace X (because the namespace declaration contains a type, Y)\nA type Y in the X namespace\nA type Z in the X namespace (the instance shape of the class)\nA value Z that is a property of the X value (the constructor function of the class)\n\nThe second  block creates the following name meanings:\n\nA value Y (of type number) that is a property of the X value\nA namespace Z\nA value Z that is a property of the X value\nA type C in the X.Z namespace\nA value C that is a property of the X.Z value\nA type X\n\nUsing with export = or import\nAn important rule is that export and import declarations export or import all meanings of their targets.\n\n"},"pages/declaration files/Templates.html":{"url":"pages/declaration

files/Publishing.html":{"url":"pages/declaration files/Publishing.html","title":"Publishing","keywords":"","body":"Now that you have authored a declaration file following the steps of this guide, it is time to publish it to npm.\nThere are two main ways you can publish your declaration files to npm:\n\nbundling with your npm package, or\npublishing to the @types organization on npm.\n\nIf you control the npm package you are publishing declarations for, then the first approach is favored.\nThat way, your declarations and JavaScript always travel together.\nIncluding declarations in your npm package\nIf your package has a main .js file, you will need to indicate the main declaration file in your package.json file as well.\nSet the types property to point to your bundled declaration file.\nFor example:\n{\n    \"name\": \"awesome\",\n    \"author\": \"Vandelay Industries\",\n    \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n    \"main\": \"./lib/main.js\",\n    \"types\": \"./lib/main.d.ts\"\n}\n\nNote that the \"typings\" field is synonymous with \"types\", and could be used as well.\nAlso note that if your main declaration file is named index.d.ts and lives at the root of the package (next to index.js) you do not need to mark the \"types\" property, though it is advisable to do so.\nDependencies\nAll dependencies are managed by npm.\nMake sure all the declaration packages you depend on are marked appropriately in the \"dependencies\" section in your package.json.\nFor example, imagine we authored a package that used Browserify and TypeScript.\n{\n    \"name\": \"browserify-typescript-extension\",\n    \"author\": \"Vandelay Industries\",\n    \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n    \"main\": \"./lib/main.js\",\n    \"types\": \"./lib/main.d.ts\",\n    \"dependencies\": {\n        \"browserify\": \"latest\",\n        \"@types/browserify\": \"latest\",\n        \"typescript\": \"next\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere, our package depends on the browserify and typescript packages.\nbrowserify does not bundle its declaration files with its npm packages, so we needed to depend on @types/browserify for its declarations.\ntypescript, on the other hand, packages its declaration files, so there was no need for any additional dependencies\nOur package exposes declarations from each of those, so any user of our browserify-typescript-extension package needs to have these dependencies as well.\nFor that reason, we used \"dependencies\" and not \"devDependencies\", because otherwise our consumers would have needed to manually install those packages.\nIf we had just written a command line application and not expected our package to be used as a library, we might have used devDependencies.\nRed flags\n/// \nDon't use ///  in your declaration files.\n/// \n....\n\nDo use ///  instead.\n/// \n....\n\nMake sure to revisit the Consuming dependencies section for more information.\nPackaging dependent declarations\nIf your type definitions depend on another package:\n\nDon't combine it with yours, keep each in their own file.\nDon't copy the declarations in your package either.\nDo depend on the npm type declaration package if it doesn't package its declaration files.\n\nPublish to @types\nPackages on under the @types organization are published automatically from DefinitelyTyped using the types-publisher tool.\nTo get your declarations published as an @types package, please submit a pull request to https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped.\nYou can find more details in the contribution guidelines page.\n"},"pages/declaration files/Consumption.html":{"url":"pages/declaration files/Consumption.html","title":"Consumption","keywords":"","body":"In TypeScript 2.0, it has become significantly easier to consume declaration files, in acquiring, using, and finding them.\nThis page details exactly how to do all three.\nDownloading\nGetting type declarations in TypeScript 2.0 and above requires no tools apart from npm.\nAs an example, getting the declarations for a library like lodash takes nothing more than the following command\nnpm install --save @types/lodash\n\nIt is worth noting that if the npm package already includes its declaration file as described in Publishing, downloading the corresponding @types package is not needed.\nConsuming\nFrom there you’ll be able to use lodash in your TypeScript code with no fuss.\nThis works for both modules and global code.\nFor example, once you’ve npm install-ed your type declarations, you can use imports and write\nimport * as _ from \"lodash\";\n_.padStart(\"Hello TypeScript!\", 20, \" \");\n\nor if you’re not using modules, you can just use the global variable _.\n_.padStart(\"Hello TypeScript!\", 20, \" \");\n\nSearching\nFor the most part, type declaration packages should always have the same name as the package name on npm, but prefixed with @types/,\n  but if you need, you can check out https://aka.ms/types to find the package for your favorite library.\n\nNote: if the declaration file you are searching for is not present, you can always contribute one back and help out the next developer looking for it.\nPlease see

containing a tsconfig.json file, or a path to a valid .json file containing the configurations.\n\nWhen input files are specified on the command line, tsconfig.json files are ignored.\nExamples\nExample tsconfig.json files:\n\nUsing the \"files\" property\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"module\": \"commonjs\",\n        \"noImplicitAny\": true,\n

property can be omitted, in which case the compiler's defaults are used. See our full list of supported Compiler Options.\nThe \"files\" property takes a list of relative or absolute file paths.\nThe \"include\" and \"exclude\" properties take a list of glob-like file patterns.\nThe supported glob wildcards are:\n\n* matches zero or more characters (excluding directory separators)\n? matches any one character (excluding directory separators)\n**/ recursively matches any subdirectory\n\nIf a segment of a glob pattern includes only * or .*, then only files with supported extensions are included (e.g. .ts, .tsx, and .d.ts by default with .js and .jsx if allowJs is set to true).\nIf the \"files\" and \"include\" are both left unspecified, the compiler defaults to including all TypeScript (.ts, .d.ts and .tsx) files in the containing directory and subdirectories except those excluded using the \"exclude\" property. JS files (.js and .jsx) are also included if allowJs is set to true.\nIf the \"files\" or \"include\" properties are specified, the compiler will instead include the union of the files included by those two properties.\nFiles in the directory specified using the \"outDir\" compiler option are always excluded unless explicitly included via the \"files\" property (even when the \"exclude\" property is specified).\nFiles included using \"include\" can be filtered using the \"exclude\" property.\nHowever, files included explicitly using the \"files\" property are always included regardless of \"exclude\".\nThe \"exclude\" property defaults to excluding the node_modules, bower_components, jspm_packages and  directories when not specified.\nAny files that are referenced by files included via the \"files\" or \"include\" properties are also included.\nSimilarly, if a file B.ts is referenced by another file A.ts, then B.ts cannot be excluded unless the referencing file A.ts is also specified in the \"exclude\" list.\nPlease note that the compiler does not include files that can be possible outputs; e.g. if the input includes index.ts, then index.d.ts and index.js are excluded.\nIn general, having files that differ only in extension next to each other is not recomended.\nA tsconfig.json file is permitted to be completely empty, which compiles all files included by default (as described above) with the default compiler options.\nCompiler options specified on the command line override those specified in the tsconfig.json file.\n@types, typeRoots and types\nBy default all visible \"@types\" packages are included in your compilation.\nPackages in node_modules/@types of any enclosing folder are considered visible;\nspecifically, that means packages within ./node_modules/@types/,  ../node_modules/@types/, ../../node_modules/@types/, and so on.\nIf typeRoots is specified, only packages under typeRoots will be included.\nFor example:\n{\n   \"compilerOptions\": {\n       \"typeRoots\" : [\"./typings\"]\n   }\n}\n\nThis config file will include all packages under ./typings, and no packages from ./node_modules/@types.\nIf types is specified, only packages listed will be included.\nFor instance:\n{\n   \"compilerOptions\": {\n       \"types\" : [\"node\", \"lodash\", \"express\"]\n   }\n}\n\nThis tsconfig.json file will only include  ./node_modules/@types/node, ./node_modules/@types/lodash and ./node_modules/@types/express.\nOther packages under node_modules/@types/* will not be included.\nSpecify \"types\": [] to disable automatic inclusion of @types packages.\nKeep in mind that automatic inclusion is only important if you're using files with global declarations (as opposed to files declared as modules).\nIf you use an import \"foo\" statement, for instance, TypeScript may still look through node_modules & node_modules/@types folders to find the foo package.\nConfiguration inheritance with extends\nA tsconfig.json file can inherit configurations from another file using the extends property.\nThe extends is a top-level property in tsconfig.json (alongside compilerOptions, files, include, and exclude).\nextends' value is a string containing a path to another configuration file to inherit from.\nThe configuration from the base file are loaded first, then overridden by those  in the inheriting config file.\nIf a circularity is encountered, we report an error.\nfiles, include and exclude from the inheriting config file overwrite those from the base config file.\nAll relative paths found in the configuration file will be resolved relative to the configuration file they originated in.\nFor example:\nconfigs/base.json:\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"noImplicitAny\": true,\n    \"strictNullChecks\": true\n  }\n}\n\ntsconfig.json:\n{\n  \"extends\": \"./configs/base\",\n  \"files\": [\n    \"main.ts\",\n    \"supplemental.ts\"\n  ]\n}\n\ntsconfig.nostrictnull.json:\n{\n  \"extends\": \"./tsconfig\",\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"strictNullChecks\": false\n  }\n}\n\ncompileOnSave\nSetting a top-level property compileOnSave signals to the IDE to generate all files for a given tsconfig.json upon saving.\n{\n   \"compileOnSave\": true,\n   \"compilerOptions\": {\n       \"noImplicitAny\" : true\n   }\n}\n\nThis feature is currently supported in Visual Studio 2015 with TypeScript 1.8.4 and above, and atom-typescript plugin.\nSchema\nSchema can be found at: http://json.schemastore.org/tsconfig\n"},"pages/Compiler Options.html":{"url":"pages/Compiler Options.html","title":"Compiler Options","keywords":"","body":"Compiler Options\n\n\n\nOption\nType\nDefault\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n--allowJs\nboolean\nfalse\nAllow JavaScript files to be compiled.\n\n\n--allowSyntheticDefaultImports\nboolean\nmodule === \"system\"\nAllow default imports from modules with no default export.

(x86)\\MSBuild\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\v$(VisualStudioVersion)\\TypeScript\\Microsoft.TypeScript.targets file.\nThe authoritative mappings between MSBuild XML tags and tsc compiler options live in there.\nToolsVersion\nThe value of 1.7 property in the project file identifies the compiler version to use to build (1.7 in this example).\nThis allows a project to build against the same versions of the compiler on different machines.\nIf TypeScriptToolsVersion is not specified, the latest compiler version installed on the machine will be used to build.\nUsers using newer versions of TS, will see a prompt to upgrade their project on first load.\nTypeScriptCompileBlocked\nIf you are using a different build tool to build your project (e.g. gulp, grunt , etc.) and VS for the development and debugging experience, set true in your project.\nThis should give you all the editing support, but not the build when you hit F5.\n"},"pages/Nightly Builds.html":{"url":"pages/Nightly

projects to use NuGet for more information.\n\nThe nightlies are available on www.myget.org.\nThere are two packages:\n\nMicrosoft.TypeScript.Compiler: Tools only (tsc.exe, lib.d.ts, etc.) .\nMicrosoft.TypeScript.MSBuild: Tools as above, as well as MSBuild tasks and targets (Microsoft.TypeScript.targets, Microsoft.TypeScript.Default.props, etc.)\n\nUpdating your IDE to use the nightly builds\nYou can also update your IDE to use the nightly drop.\nFirst you will need to install the package through npm.\nYou can either install the npm package globally or to a local node_modules folder.\nThe rest of this section assumes typescript@next is already installed.\nVisual Studio Code\nUpdate .vscode/settings.json with the following:\n\"typescript.tsdk\": \"/node_modules/typescript/lib\"\n\nMore information is available at VSCode documentation.\nSublime Text\nUpdate the Settings - User file with the following:\n\"typescript_tsdk\": \"/node_modules/typescript/lib\"\n\nMore information is available at the TypeScript Plugin for Sublime Text installation documentation.\nVisual Studio 2013 and 2015\n\nNote: Most changes do not require you to install a new version of the VS TypeScript plugin.\n\nThe nightly build currently does not include the full plugin setup, but we are working on publishing an installer on a nightly basis as well.\n\nDownload the VSDevMode.ps1 script.\n\nAlso see our wiki page on using a custom language service file.\n\n\nFrom a PowerShell command window, run:\nFor VS 2015:\nVSDevMode.ps1 14 -tsScript /node_modules/typescript/lib\n\nFor VS 2013:\nVSDevMode.ps1 12 -tsScript /node_modules/typescript/lib\n\n\n\nIntelliJ IDEA (Mac)\nGo to Preferences > Languages & Frameworks >
