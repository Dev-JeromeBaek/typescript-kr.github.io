TypeScript","keywords":"","body":"TypeScript로 간단한 웹 애플리케이션 만들기를 시작해봅시다.\nTypeScript 설치하기 (Installing TypeScript)\nTypeScript를 설치하는 방법은 크게 두가지입니다:\n\nNPM을 통해 설치 (Node.js 패키지 매니저)\nTypeScript의 Visual Studio 플러그인 설치\n\nVisual Studio 2017 및 Visual Studio 2015 Update 3에는 기본적으로 TypeScript가 포함되어 있습니다.\nVisual Studio와 함꼐 TypeScript를 설치하지 않았다면 다운로드할 수 있습니다.\nNPM 사용자의 경우:\n> npm install -g typescript\n\n첫번째 TypeScript 파일 만들기 (Building your first TypeScript file)\n편집기에서 greeter.ts파일을 만들고 다음 JavaScript 코드를 입력하십시오:\nfunction greeter(person) {\n    return \"Hello, \" + person;\n}\n\nlet user = \"Jane User\";\n\ndocument.body.innerHTML = greeter(user);\n\n코드 컴파일하기 (Compiling your code)\n우리는 .ts 확장자를 사용했지만, 이 코드는 그냥 JavaScript입니다.\n기존 JavaScript 앱에서 바로 복사 / 붙여넣기 할 수 있습니다.\n명령줄에서 TypeScript 컴파일러를 실행합니다:\ntsc greeter.ts\n\n결과는 동일한 JavaScript를 포함하고있는 greeter.js 파일이 될 것입니다.\nJavaScript 애플리케이션에서 TypeScript를 실행 중입니다!\n이제 TypeScript가 제공하는 새로운 기능들을 활용할 수 있습니다.\n다음과 같이 'person' 함수의 인수에 : string 타입 어노테이션을 추가하십시오:\nfunction greeter(person: string) {\n    return \"Hello, \" + person;\n}\n\nlet user = \"Jane User\";\n\ndocument.body.innerHTML = greeter(user);\n\n타입 어노테이션 (Type annotations)\nTypeScript의 타입 어노테이션은 함수 또는 변수의 의도된 계약을 적는 간단한 방법입니다.\n이 경우 greeter 함수를 단일 문자열 매개변수로 호출하려고 합니다.\n여기서 우리는 greeter 함수에 문자열 대신 배열을 전달하여 호출할 수도 있을 것입니다:\nfunction greeter(person: string) {\n    return \"Hello, \" + person;\n}\n\nlet user = [0, 1, 2];\n\ndocument.body.innerHTML = greeter(user);\n\n다시 컴파일하면, 오류가 표시됩니다.\nerror TS2345: Argument of type 'number[]' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.\n\n마찬가지로, greeter를 호출할 때 모든 인수를 제거해보십시오.\nTypeScript는 예상치 못한 매개변수로 함수를 호출했다는 것을 알려줍니다.\n두 경우 모두 TypeScript는 코드 구조와 사용자가 제공한 타입 어노테이션을 기반으로 정적 분석을 제공할 수 있습니다.\n에러가 있었음에도 불구하고, greeter.js 파일은 여전히 생성됩니다.\n코드에 오류가 있어도 TypeScript를 사용할 수 있습니다. 그러나 이 경우에 TypeScript는 코드가 예상대로 실행되지 않을 것이라고 경고합니다.\n인터페이스 (Interfaces)\n예제를 더 발전시켜 봅시다. 여기서는 firstName 및 lastName 필드가 있는 객체를 설명하는 인터페이스를 사용합니다.\nTypeSciprt에서는 두가지 타입이 내부 구조가 호환되면 호환됩니다.\n이것은 명시적으로 implements 구문 없이 인터페이스가 요구하는 형태를 가짐으로써 인터페이스를 구현할 수 있게 해줍니다.\ninterface Person {\n    firstName: string;\n    lastName: string;\n}\n\nfunction greeter(person: Person) {\n    return \"Hello, \" + person.firstName + \" \" + person.lastName;\n}\n\nlet user = { firstName: \"Jane\", lastName: \"User\" };\n\ndocument.body.innerHTML = greeter(user);\n\n클래스 (Classes)\n마지막으로 클래스를 사용하여 예제를 확장해 보겠습니다.\nTypeScript는 클래스 기반 객체 지향 프로그래밍과 같은 JavaScript의 새로운 기능을 지원합니다.\n여기서는 생성자와 몇 개의 public 필드를 사용하여 Student 클래스를 생성 할 것입니다.\n클래스와 인터페이스가 잘 작동하여 프로그래머가 올바른 수준의 추상화를 결정할 수 있습니다.\n또한 생성자에 대한 인수에 public 을 사용하는 것은 그 이름으로 속성을 자동으로 생성 할 수 있는 단축형태입니다.\nclass Student {\n    fullName: string;\n    constructor(public firstName: string, public middleInitial: string, public lastName: string) {\n        this.fullName = firstName + \" \" + middleInitial + \" \" + lastName;\n    }\n}\n\ninterface Person {\n    firstName: string;\n    lastName: string;\n}\n\nfunction greeter(person : Person) {\n    return \"Hello, \" + person.firstName + \" \" + person.lastName;\n}\n\nlet user = new Student(\"Jane\", \"M.\", \"User\");\n\ndocument.body.innerHTML = greeter(user);\n\ntsc greeter.ts 를 다시 실행하면 생성된 JavaScript가 이전 코드와 동일하다는 것을 알 수 있습니다.\nTypeScript의 클래스는 JavaScript에서 자주 사용되는 것과 동일한 프로토 타입 기반 OO의 줄임말입니다.\nTypeScript 웹 앱 실행하기 (Running your TypeScript web app)\n이제 greeter.html 에 다음을 입력하십시오:\n\n\n    TypeScript Greeter\n    \n        \n    \n\n\n첫번째 간단한 TypeScript 웹 애플리케이션을 실행하기 위해 브라우저에서 greeter.html 을 여십시오!\n옵션 : Visual Studio에서 greeter.ts 를 열거나 코드를 TypeScript 플레이그라운드로 복사하십시오.\n식별자 위로 마우스를 가져가면 타입을 볼 수 있습니다.\n경우에 따라 이러한 타입이 자동으로 추론됩니다.\n마지막 줄을 다시 입력하고 DOM 요소의 타입에 따라 완료 목록 및 매개변수 도움말을 확인하십시오.\ngreeter 함수에 대한 참조에 커서를 놓고 F12 키를 눌러 해당 정의로 이동할 수 있습니다.\n기호를 마우스 오른쪽 버튼으로 클릭하고 리팩토링을 사용하여 심볼의 이름을 바꿀 수 있습니다.\n제공된 타입 정보는 애플리케이션 규모에서 JavaScript로 작업할수 있는 도구와 함께 작동합니다.\nTypeScript에서 가능한 모든 예제는

TypeScript를 포함시키기 위해 알아야 할 것은 이것뿐입니다.다음으로 간단한 Angular 앱을 작성합니다.\n앵귤러 2 추가 (Add Angular 2)\nNPM 의존성 추가 (Add NPM dependencies)\npackage.json의 dependencies에 Angular 2와 SystemJS를 추가하십시오.\nVS2015의 경우는 새로운 dependencies 리스트 :\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"angular2\": \"2.0.0-beta.11\",\n    \"systemjs\": \"0.19.24\",\n    \"gulp\": \"3.9.0\",\n    \"del\": \"2.2.0\"\n  },\n\nVS2017의 경우 NPM3에서 peer 의존성이 사용되지 않으므로 Angular 2의 peer 의존성을 의존성으로 직접 나열해야 합니다 :\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"angular2\": \"2.0.0-beta.11\",\n    \"reflect-metadata\": \"0.1.2\",\n    \"rxjs\": \"5.0.0-beta.2\",\n    \"zone.js\":

지원이 필요합니다.또한 Promise과 같은 것들에는 Angular가 core-js를 사용하기 때문에 ES2015에 선언을 추가해야 합니다.향후에는 데코레이터가 기본이 될 것이므로 이러한 설정은 필요하지 않을 것입니다.\n\"experimentalDecorators\": true, \"emitDecoratorMetadata\": true를 \"compilerOptions\"에 추가하십시오.그런 다음 ES2015에서 선언을 가져오려면 \"lib\": [\"es2015\", \"es5\", \"dom\"]을 \"compilerOptions\" 에 추가하십시오.  \n마지막으로 만들 \"./model.ts\"를 \"files\"에 새 항목을 추가해야 합니다.tsconfig는 다음과 같이 보일 것입니다 :\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"noImplicitAny\": true,\n        \"noEmitOnError\": true,\n        \"sourceMap\": true,\n        \"experimentalDecorators\": true,\n

 gulp.src(paths.scripts).pipe(gulp.dest('wwwroot/scripts'));\n});\n\n다시 한번 gulpfile을 저장한 후에는 Task Runner Explorer가 새로운 lib 작업을 보게해야 합니다.\nTypeScript에 간단한 Angular 애플리케이션 작성 (Write a simple Angular app in TypeScript)\n먼저 app.ts의 코드를 다음과 같이 변경하십시오 :\nimport {Component} from \"angular2/core\"\nimport {MyModel} from \"./model\"\n\n@Component({\n    selector: `my-app`,\n    template: `Hello from

:\nexport class MyModel {\n    compiler = \"TypeScript\";\n}\n\n그리고 scripts에 main.ts라는 또 다른 TypeScript 파일이 있습니다 :\nimport {bootstrap} from \"angular2/platform/browser\";\nimport {MyApp} from \"./app\";\nbootstrap(MyApp);\n\n마지막으로 index.html의 코드를 다음과 같이 변경하십시오 :\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    System.config({\n        packages: {\n            'scripts': {\n

\nBrowserify\n이제 이 프로젝트를 노드에서 브라우저로 이동하겠습니다.이를 위해 모든 모듈을 하나의 JavaScript 파일로 번들링 하고자 합니다.다행히도 정확히 Browserify가 하는 일입니다.더 좋은 것은 노드에서 사용하는 CommonJS 모듈 시스템을 TypeScript에서 사용할 수 있다는 것입니다.즉 TypeScript와 Node 설정이 기본적으로 변경되지 않은 브라우저로 전송되는 것을 의미합니다.\n먼저 browserify, tsify 및 vinyl-source-stream을 설치하십시오.tsify는 gulp-typescript처럼 Typeify 컴파일러에 접근할 수 있는 Browserify 플러그인입니다.vinyl-source-stream을 사용하면 Browserify의 파일 출력을 gulp에서 vinyl으로 인식하는 형식으로 다시 변환할 수 있습니다.\nnpm install --save-dev browserify tsify vinyl-source-stream\n\n페이지 만들기 (Create a page)\nsrc에 index.html 파일을 생성합니다 :\n\n\n    \n        \n        Hello

elt = document.getElementById(divName);\n    elt.innerText = sayHello(name);\n}\n\nshowHello(\"greeting\", \"TypeScript\");\n\nshowHello 호출은 sayHello를 호출하여 paragraph 텍스트를 변경합니다.이제 gulpfile을 다음과 같이 변경하십시오 :\nvar gulp = require(\"gulp\");\nvar browserify = require(\"browserify\");\nvar source = require('vinyl-source-stream');\nvar tsify = require(\"tsify\");\nvar paths = {\n    pages: ['src/*.html']\n};\n\ngulp.task(\"copy-html\", function () {\n    return gulp.src(paths.pages)\n        .pipe(gulp.dest(\"dist\"));\n});\n\ngulp.task(\"default\", [\"copy-html\"], function () {\n

.pipe(source('bundle.js'))\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(\"dist\"));\n});\n\ncopy-html 태스크를 추가하고 default의 의존성으로 추가합니다.default가 실행될 때마다 copy-html이 먼저 실행되어야 한다는 것을 의미합니다.또한 default를 gulp-typescript 대신 tsify 플러그인으로 Browserify를 호출하도록 변경했습니다.편리하게도 둘 모두 TypeScript 컴파일러에 동일한 options 객체를 전달할 수 있습니다.\nbundle을 호출한 후 source(vinil-source-stream에 대한 별칭)를 사용하여 출력 번들 bundle.js의 이름을 지정합니다.\ngulp를 실행하고 브라우저에서 dist/index.html을 열어 페이지를 테스트하십시오.페이지에 \"Hello from TypeScript\"가 표시되어야 합니다.\nBrowserify에 debug : true를 지정한 것에 주목하십시오.이로 인해 tsify는 번들 JavaScript 파일 내에서 소스맵을 내보냅니다.소스 맵을 사용하면 번들로 제공된 JavaScript 대신 브라우저에서 원본 TypeScript 코드를 디버깅할 수 있습니다.브라우저의 디버거를 열고 main.ts 안에 브레이크포인트을 넣으면 소스 맵이 작동하는지 테스트할 수 있습니다.페이지를 새로 고침 할 때 브레이크포인트가 페이지를 일시 중지하고 greet.ts를 디버깅 할 수 있도록 해야 합니다.\nWatchify, Babel, and Uglify\n이제 코드를 Browserify에 묶어서 tsify 했으므로 browserify 플러그인을 사용하여 빌드에 다양한 기능을 추가할 수 있습니다.\n\nWatchify가 gulp를 계속 실행하며 파일을 저장할 때마다 점차적으로 컴파일합니다.이를 통해 브라우저에서 편집-저장-새로고침 사이클을 계속 진행할 수 있습니다.\n\nBabel은 ES2015 이상을 ES5 및 ES3으로 변환하는 매우 유연한 컴파일러입니다.따라서 TypeScript에서 지원하지 않는 광범위한 맞춤형 변환을 추가할 수 있습니다.\n\nUglify는 다운로드 시간을 줄이도록 코드를 압축합니다.\n\n\nWatchify\nWatchify로 백그라운드 컴파일을 시작하겠습니다 :\nnpm install --save-dev watchify gulp-util\n\n이제 gulpfile을 다음과 같이 변경하십시오 :\nvar gulp = require(\"gulp\");\nvar browserify = require(\"browserify\");\nvar source = require('vinyl-source-stream');\nvar watchify = require(\"watchify\");\nvar tsify = require(\"tsify\");\nvar gutil = require(\"gulp-util\");\nvar paths = {\n    pages: ['src/*.html']\n};\n\nvar watchedBrowserify = watchify(browserify({\n

.pipe(gulp.dest(\"dist\"));\n}\n\ngulp.task(\"default\", [\"copy-html\"], bundle);\nwatchedBrowserify.on(\"update\", bundle);\nwatchedBrowserify.on(\"log\", gutil.log);\n\n여기에는 기본적으로 세 가지 변경 사항이 있지만 코드를 약간 리팩토링해야합니다.\n\nwatchify에 대한 호출에서 browserify 인스턴스를 감싸고 그 결과를 유지했습니다.\nwatchedBrowserify.on(\"update\", bundle);을 호출하여 Browserify 가 TypeScript 파일 중 하나가 변경될 때마다 bundle 함수를 실행하도록 했습니다.\nwatchedBrowserify.on(\"log\", gutil.log);을 호출하여 콘솔에 로그했습니다.\n\n(1)과 (2)는 default 작업에서 browserify를 호출해야 한다는 것을 의미합니다.Watchify와 Gulp 모두 호출해야 하기 때문에 default 함수에 이름을 주어야 합니다.(3)을 사용한 로깅을 추가하는 것은 선택 사항이지만 설정을 디버깅하는 데 매우 유용합니다.\n이제 Gulp를 실행하면 시작해야 하고 계속 실행됩니다.main.ts에서 showHello에 대한 코드를 변경하고 저장하십시오.  \n다음과 같은 출력이 표시되어야 합니다 :\nproj$ gulp\n[10:34:20] Using gulpfile ~/src/proj/gulpfile.js\n[10:34:20]

합니다.\nnpm install --save-dev gulp-uglify vinyl-buffer gulp-sourcemaps\n\n이제 gulpfile을 다음과 같이 변경하십시오 :\nvar gulp = require(\"gulp\");\nvar browserify = require(\"browserify\");\nvar source = require('vinyl-source-stream');\nvar tsify = require(\"tsify\");\nvar uglify = require('gulp-uglify');\nvar sourcemaps = require('gulp-sourcemaps');\nvar buffer = require('vinyl-buffer');\nvar paths = {\n    pages: ['src/*.html']\n};\n\ngulp.task(\"copy-html\", function () {\n    return gulp.src(paths.pages)\n        .pipe(gulp.dest(\"dist\"));\n});\n\ngulp.task(\"default\", [\"copy-html\"], function () {\n    return browserify({\n        basedir: '.',\n        debug: true,\n        entries: ['src/main.ts'],\n        cache: {},\n        packageCache: {}\n    })\n    .plugin(tsify)\n    .bundle()\n    .pipe(source('bundle.js'))\n    .pipe(buffer())\n    .pipe(sourcemaps.init({loadMaps: true}))\n    .pipe(uglify())\n    .pipe(sourcemaps.write('./'))\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(\"dist\"));\n});\n\nuglify 자체에는 하나의 호출만 있습니다 — buffer와 sourcemaps에 대한 호출은 sourcemaps이 계속 작동하는지 확인하기 위해 존재합니다.이러한 호출을 통해 이전과 같이 인라인 소스 맵을 사용하는 대신 별도의 소스 맵 파일을 사용할 수 있습니다.이제 Gulp를 실행하고 bundle.js가 난독화로 압축되는지 확인하십시오 :\ngulp\ncat dist/bundle.js\n\nBabel\n먼저 ES2015 전용 Babelify 및 Babel preset을 설치하십시오.Uglify처럼 Babelify도 코드를 엉망으로 만들기 때문에 vinyl-buffer와 gulp-sourcemaps이 필요합니다.기본적으로 Babelify는 확장자가 .js, .es, .es6 및 .jsx 인 파일만 처리하므로 Babelify에 옵션으로 .ts 확장자를 추가해야 합니다.\nnpm install --save-dev babelify babel-core babel-preset-es2015 vinyl-buffer gulp-sourcemaps\n\n이제 gulpfile을 다음과 같이 변경하십시오 :\nvar gulp = require('gulp');\nvar browserify = require('browserify');\nvar source = require('vinyl-source-stream');\nvar tsify = require('tsify');\nvar sourcemaps = require('gulp-sourcemaps');\nvar buffer = require('vinyl-buffer');\nvar paths = {\n    pages: ['src/*.html']\n};\n\ngulp.task('copyHtml', function () {\n    return gulp.src(paths.pages)\n        .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'));\n});\n\ngulp.task('default', ['copyHtml'], function () {\n    return browserify({\n        basedir: '.',\n        debug: true,\n        entries: ['src/main.ts'],\n        cache: {},\n        packageCache: {}\n    })\n    .plugin(tsify)\n    .transform('babelify', {\n        presets: ['es2015'],\n        extensions: ['.ts']\n    })\n    .bundle()\n    .pipe(source('bundle.js'))\n    .pipe(buffer())\n    .pipe(sourcemaps.init({loadMaps: true}))\n    .pipe(sourcemaps.write('./'))\n    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'));\n});\n\nTypeScript 대상 ES2015도 필요합니다.Babel은 TypeScript에서 내보내는 ES2015 코드에서 ES5를 생성합니다.\ntsconfig.json을 수정합시다 :\n{\n    \"files\": [\n        \"src/main.ts\"\n    ],\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"noImplicitAny\": true,\n

디렉토리가 다음과 같이 설정되었다고 가정할 것입니다:\nprojectRoot\n├── src\n│   ├── file1.js\n│   └── file2.js\n├── built\n└── tsconfig.json\n\nsrc 디렉토리 밖에 tests 폴더가 있다면 src에 tsconfig.json와 tests에 하나씩 가질 수 있습니다.\n설정 파일 작성하기 (Writing a Configuration File)\nTypeScript는 tsconfig.json이라는 파일을 사용하여 포함시킬 파일과 검사의 종류와 같은 프로젝트의 옵션을 관리합니다.프로젝트에 사용할 기본적인 뼈대를 생성하겠습니다:\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"outDir\": \"./built\",\n        \"allowJs\": true,\n        \"target\": \"es5\"\n    },\n    \"include\": [\n        \"./src/**/*\"\n    ]\n}\n\n여기서 TypeScript에 몇 가지를 지정합니다:\n\nsrc 디렉토리에의 모든 파일을 읽습니다 (include 포함)\nJavaScript 파일의 입력으로 허용합니다 (allowJs 포함)\nbuiltd에 모든 출력 파일을 내 보냅니다 (outDir와 함께)\n최신 JavaScript 구문을 ECMAScript 5 같은 이전 버전으로 변환합니다 (target 사용)\n\n이때 프로젝트 루트에 tsc를 실행하려고 하면 built 디렉토리에 출력 파일이 표시됩니다.built에 있는 파일의 레이아웃은 src의 레이아웃과 동일해야 합니다.이제 프로젝트에서 TypeScript로 작업해야 합니다.\n초기의 혜택 (Early Benefits)\n이 시점에서도 TypeScript에서 프로젝트를 이해함으로써 몇 가지 뛰어난 이점을 누릴 수 있습니다.VS Code나 Visual Studio 같은 편집기로 시작하면 자동 완성과 같은 도구 지원을 자주 받을 수 있습니다.또한 다음과 같은 옵션을 사용하여 특정 버그를 발견할 수도 있습니다:\n\nnoImplicitReturns는 함수의 끝에 반환문을 빼먹는 것을 방지합니다.\nnoFallthroughCasesInSwitch는 switch블록 case 사이에 break문을 뻬먹지 않기 위해 유용합니다.\n\nTypeScript는 도달 할 수없는 코드와 라벨에 대해서도 경고합니다.이 코드와 라벨은 각각의 allowUnreachableCode와 allowUnusedLabels로 해제할 수 있습니다.\n빌드 도구와 통합 (Integrating with Build Tools)\n파이프 라인에 빌드 단계가 더 있을 수 있습니다.아마도 각 파일에 무언가를 연결했을 것입니다.각 빌드 도구는 다르지만 각 빌드 도구의 요점을 다루기 위해 최선을 다할 것입니다.\nGulp\nGulp를 사용하는 경우 TypeScript로 Gulp 사용하기 튜토리얼이 있고 Browserify와 Babelify 그리고 Uglify와 같은 일반적인 빌드 도구와 통합됩니다.거기서 더 읽을 수 있습니다.\nWebpack\nWebpack 통합은 매우 간단합니다.\nTypeScript 로더인 awesome-typescript-loader를 source-map-loader와 결합하여 사용하면 디버깅이 쉬워 집니다.  \n간단한 실행\nnpm install awesome-typescript-loader source-map-loader\n\n그리고 다음의 옵션을 webpack.config.js 파일에 병합하십시오 :\nmodule.exports = {\n    entry: \"./src/index.ts\",\n    output: {\n        filename: \"./dist/bundle.js\",\n    },\n\n    // webpack의 출력을 디버깅 할 소스 맵을 사용하도록 설정합니다.\n    devtool: \"source-map\",\n\n    resolve: {\n        // 확인 가능한 확장자로 '.ts' 및 '.tsx'를 추가합니다.\n        extensions: [\"\", \".webpack.js\", \".web.js\", \".ts\", \".tsx\", \".js\"]\n    },\n\n    module: {\n        loaders: [\n            // '.ts' 또는 '.tsx' 확장자를 가진 모든 파일은 'awesome-typescript-loader'에 의해 처리됩니다.\n            { test: /\\.tsx?$/, loader: \"awesome-typescript-loader\" }\n        ],\n\n        preLoaders: [\n            // '.js' 파일의 모든 출력에는 'source-maps-loader'로 다시 처리된 소스 맵이 있습니다.\n            { test: /\\.js$/, loader: \"source-map-loader\" }\n        ]\n    },\n\n    // 다른 옵션들...\n};\n\n.js 파일을 다루는 다른 로더보다 awesome-typescript-loader를 먼저 실행해야 한다는 점에 주의해야 합니다.Webpack을 위한 TypeScript 로더인 ts-loader도 마찬가지입니다.여기에서. 그 둘의 차이점에 대해 더 읽어볼 수 있다. \nReact and Webpack에 관한 튜토리얼에서 Webpack을 사용하는 예를 볼 수 있습니다.\nTypeScript 파일로 이동 (Moving to TypeScript Files)\n이때 TypeScript 파일을 사용할 준비가 된 것입니다.첫 번째 단계는 .js 파일 중 하나의 이름을 .ts로 바꾸는 것입니다.파일이 JSX를 사용한다면 이름을 .tsx로 바꿔야 합니다.\n그 단계를 끝냈나요?\n좋았어!JavaScript에서 TypeScript로 파일을 성공적으로 마이그레이션 했습니다!\n물론 옳다고 생각하지 않을 수도 있습니다.TypeScript를 지원하는 편집기에서 해당 파일을 열면 (또는 tsc --pretty를 실행하면) 특정 라인에 빨간 줄이 나타날 수 있습니다.Microsoft Word와 같은 편집기에서 빨간 줄을 생각하는 것과 같은 방식으로 생각해야합니다.Word에서 여전히 문서를 인쇄할 수 있는 것처럼 TypeScript는 코드를 변환합니다.\n그 경고가 너무 느슨하면 그 경고를 엄격하게 할 수 있습니다.예를 들어 오류 발생으로 인해 TypeScript에서 JavaScript로 컴파일하는 것을 원치 않는 경우 noEmitOnError 옵션을 사용할 수 있습니다.그런 의미에서 TypeScript는 엄격함을 조절할 수 있는 도구를 가지고 있으며 원하는 만큼 조절할 수 있습니다.\n만약 사용 가능한 더 엄격한 설정을 사용할 계획이라면 지금 바로 설정하는 것이 가장 좋습니다.(아래의 Getting Stricter Checks 참조).\n예를 들어 TypeScript가 타입에 대해 any를 추론하지 않도록 명시하려면 파일을 수정하기 전에 noImplicitAny를 사용할 수 있습니다.다소 벅차다고 느껴질 수도 있지만 장기적 이득은 훨씬 더 빨리 나타납니다.\n오류 잡기 (Weeding out Errors)\n앞서 언급 한 것처럼 변환 후에 오류 메시지가 표시되는 것은 예상치 못한 일이 아닙니다.중요한 것은 이런 것들을 하나씩 살펴보고 어떻게 오류를 처리할 것인지를 결정하는 것입니다.종종 이것들은 문제없는 버그가 될 수도 있지만 때로는 TypeScript를 위해 조금 더 나은 것을 설명해야 할 것입니다.\n모듈 가져오기 (Importing from Modules)\nCannot find name 'require'.와 Cannot find name 'define'. 같은 오류가 발생하기 시작할 수 있습니다.이러한 경우 모듈을 사용하고 있을 가능성이 높습니다.\nTypeScript로 작성하는 동안 확실할 수 있지만\n// Node/CommonJS를 위한\ndeclare function require(path: string): any;\n\n또는\n// RequireJS/AMD를 위한\ndeclare function define(...args: any[]): any;\n\n이러한 호출들은 제거하고 import에 TypeScript 구문을 사용하는 것이 좋습니다.\n먼저 TypeScript의 module 플래그를 설정하여 일부 모듈 시스템을 활성화해야 합니다.유효한 옵션은commonjs,amd,system 그리고 umd입니다.\n다음 Node/CommonJS 코드를 가지고 있는 경우:\nvar foo = require(\"foo\");\n\nfoo.doStuff();\n\n또는 다음 RequireJS / AMD 코드:\ndefine([\"foo\"], function(foo) {\n    foo.doStuff();\n})\n\n그러면 다음과 같은 TypeScript 코드를 작성하게 됩니다:\nimport foo = require(\"foo\");\n\nfoo.doStuff();\n\n선언 파일 가져 오기 (Getting Declaration Files)\nTypeScript로 전환하기 시작하면 Cannot find module 'foo'.과 같은 오류가 발생할 수 있습니다.여기서 문제는 라이브러리를 설명할 수 있는 선언 파일(declaration files) 을 가지고 있지 않다는 것입니다.다행히도 이것은 꽤 쉽습니다.TypeScript에서 lodash와 같은 패키지에 대해 불평하는 경우 그냥 작성할 수 있습니다.\nnpm install -S @types/lodash\n\ncommonjs가 아닌 다른 모듈 옵션을 사용한다면 moduleResolution 옵션을 node로 설정해야 합니다.\n그런 다음 문제없이 Lodash를 가져올 수 있으며 자동 완성을 얻을 수 있습니다.\n모듈 내보내기 (Exporting from Modules)\n전형적으로 모듈에서 내보내기는 exports 나 module.exports와 같은 값에 프로퍼티를 추가하는 것을 포함합니다.TypeScript를 사용하면 최상위 레벨 내보내기 명령문을 허용할 수 있습니다.\n예를 들어 이와 같은 함수를 내보낸 경우:\nmodule.exports.feedPets = function(pets) {\n    // ...\n}\n\n다음과 같이 작성할 수 있습니다:\nexport function feedPets(pets) {\n    // ...\n}\n\n때로는 exports 객체를 완전히 덮어쓰기도 합니다.\n이것은 모듈을 이 코드처럼 즉시 호출 가능한 모듈로 만들기 위해 사용하는 일반적인 패턴입니다:\nvar express = require(\"express\");\nvar app = express();\n\n이전에는 이렇게 작성했을 수도 있습니다 :\nfunction foo() {\n    // ...\n}\nmodule.exports = foo;\n\nTypeScript에서는 이것을 export = 구조로 모델링할 수 있습니다.\nfunction foo() {\n    // ...\n}\nexport = foo;\n\n너무 많거나 적은 인수 (Too many/too few arguments)\n때때로 너무나 많거나 적은 인수를 가진 함수를 호출할 때가 있습니다.전형적으로 이것은 버그이지만 어떤 경우에는 매개 변수를 쓰는 대신 arguments 객체를 사용하는 함수를 선언했을 수도 있습니다:\nfunction myCoolFunction() {\n    if (arguments.length == 2 && !Array.isArray(arguments[1])) {\n        var f = arguments[0];\n        var arr = arguments[1];\n        // ...\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n\nmyCoolFunction(function(x) { console.log(x) }, [1, 2, 3, 4]);\nmyCoolFunction(function(x) { console.log(x) }, 1, 2, 3, 4);\n\n이런 경우에는 TypeScript를 사용하여 myCoolfunction이 함수 오버로드를 통해 호출될 수 있는 방법에 대해 알려주어야 합니다.\nfunction myCoolFunction(f: (x: number) => void, nums: number[]): void;\nfunction myCoolFunction(f: (x: number) => void, ...nums: number[]): void;\nfunction myCoolFunction() {\n    if (arguments.length == 2 && !Array.isArray(arguments[1])) {\n        var f = arguments[0];\n        var arr = arguments[1];\n        // ...\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n\nmyCoolFunction에 두 개의 오버로드를 추가했습니다.\n첫 번째 검사는 myCoolFunction가 (number를 갖는) 함수에 number의 목록을 가집니다.\n두번째는 함수도 갖춰야 한다는 것이고 그 뒤에 오는 인수가 숫자여야 한다는 것을 알리기 위해 나머지 매개변수(...nums)를 사용합니다.\n순차적으로 추가되는 프로퍼티 (Sequentially Added Properties)\n어떤 사람들은 다음과 같이 즉시 객체를 생성하고 속성을 추가하는 것이 더 예술적으로 즐겁다는 것을 알게됩니다:\nvar options = {};\noptions.color = \"red\";\noptions.volume = 11;\n\nTypeScript는 options의 타입을 어떠한 프로퍼티도 갖지 않는 {}로 먼저 찾아냈기 때문에 volume과 color에 할당할 수 없다고 말할 것입니다.대신 선언을 객체 리터럴 자체로 옮기면 오류가 발생하지 않습니다:\nlet options = {\n    color: \"red\",\n    volume: 11\n};\n\noptions의 타입을 정의하고 객체 리터럴에 타입 단언(type assertion)을 추가 할 수도 있습니다.\ninterface Options { color: string; volume: number }\n\nlet options = {} as Options;\noptions.color = \"red\";\noptions.volume = 11;\n\n또는 options에 any 타입이라고 하는 것이 가장 쉬운 방법이지만 가장 이득이 적은 일이 될 것입니다.\nany와 Object 그리고 {} (any, Object, and {})\n대부분의 경우 Object가 가장 일반적인 타입이기 때문에 Object 또는 {}를 사용하여 값에 프로퍼티를 포함할 수 있다고 말할 수 있습니다.하지만 any가 가장 유연한 타입이기 때문에 이러한 상황에서 실제로 사용하려는 타입입니다.\n예를 들어 Object 타입을 가지고 있다면 toLowerCase()와 같은 메서드를 호출할 수 없습니다.  \n좀 더 일반적이라는 것은 보통 타입을 사용하는 것이 적다는 것을 의미하지만 가장 일반적인 타입인 any는 여전히 어떤 것이든 할 수 있게 허용해준다는 점에서 특별합니다.즉 호출하여 구성하고 프로퍼티를 조작할 수 있습니다.하지만 any를 사용하면 TypeScript가 제공하는 대부분의 오류 검사 및 편집기 지원을 잃어 버리게 됩니다.\nObject와 {}로 판결났다면 {}을 선호해야 합니다.그것들은 대체로 같지만 비밀스러운 경우에는 기술적으로 {}가 Object보다 더 일반적인 타입입니다.\n엄격한 검사 받기 (Getting Stricter Checks)\nTypeScript는 프로그램의 안전성과 분석을 제공하기 위해 특정 검사를 제공합니다.일단 코드 베이스를 TypeScript로 변환한 후에는 이러한 검사를 활성화하여 안전성을 높일 수 있습니다.\n암시적인 any는 No (No Implicit any)\n타이프 스크립트가 어떤 타입이어야 할지 모르는 특정한 경우가 있습니다.가능하면 관대하기 위해 그 자리에 any 타입을 사용하기로 결정할 것입니다.이는 마이 그레이션에는 매우 유용하지만 any를 사용하면 어떠한 유형의 안전도 확보할 수 없으며 다른 곳에서 얻을 수 있는 것과 도구의 지원을 받을 수 없습니다.TypeScript에서 이러한 위치를 기록하도록 지시하고 noImplicitAny 옵션으로 오류를 표시할 수 있습니다.\n엄격한 null과 undefined 체크 (Strict null & undefined Checks)\n기본적으로 TypeScript는 null과 undefined이 모든 타입의 범위에 있다고 가정합니다.즉 number 타입으로 선언된 모든 것이 null 또는 undefined 일 수 있음을 의미합니다.  \nnull과 undefined는 JavaScript와 TypeScript에서 자주 발생하는 버그의 원천이기 때문에 TypeScript는 이에 대한 걱정을 덜어주기 위해 strictNullChecks 옵션을 가지고 있습니다.  \nstrictNullChecks가 활성화되면 null과 undefined는 null과 undefined 각각의 타입을 갖습니다.\n혹시 null 일 수 있는 항목이 있을 때 원래 타입을 union 타입으로 사용할 수 있습니다.그렇기 때문에 타입이 number(이)거나 null 일 수 있는 경우 해당 타입을 number | null로 쓰면 됩니다.\nTypeScript가 null /undefined라고 생각하는 값을 가지고 있지만 더 잘 알고 있다면 후위 연산자 !를 사용하여 다르게 사용할 수 있습니다.\ndeclare var foo: string[] | null;\n\nfoo.length;  // 오류 - 'foo'는 'null'일 수 있습니다.\n\nfoo!.length; // 좋아요 - 'foo!'에 'string[]'타입이 있습니다.\n\n참고로 strictNullChecks를 사용할 때는 strictNullChecks도 사용하기 위해 의존성을 업데이트해야 할 수도 있습니다.\n묵시적인 this의 any No! (No Implicit any for this)\n클래스 밖에서 this 키워드를 사용할 때 기본적으로 any 타입을 가집니다.\n예를 들어 Point 클래스를 생각하여 메서드로 추가하고자 하는 함수를 작성해보세요 :\nclass Point {\n    constructor(public x, public y) {}\n    getDistance(p: Point) {\n        let dx = p.x - this.x;\n        let dy = p.y - this.y;\n        return Math.sqrt(dx ** 2 + dy ** 2);\n    }\n}\n// ...\n\n// 인터페이스를 다시 열어보세요\ninterface Point {\n    distanceFromOrigin(point: Point): number;\n}\nPoint.prototype.distanceFromOrigin = function(point: Point) {\n    return this.getDistance({ x: 0, y: 0});\n}\n\n이것은 위에서 언급한 것과 동일한 문제를 가지고 있습니다 - getDistance의 철자가 틀리거나 오류가 발생하지 않을 수 있습니다.이러한 이유로 TypeScript는 noImplicitThis 옵션을 가지고 있습니다.이 옵션을 설정하면 TypeScript에서 명시적(또는 추론된) 타입 없이 this를 사용할 경우 오류가 발생합니다.\n해결책은 인터페이스나 함수 자체에 this-매개변수를 사용하여 명확한 타입을 제공하는 것입니다:\nPoint.prototype.distanceFromOrigin = function(this: Point, point: Point) {\n    return this.getDistance({ x: 0, y: 0});\n}\n\n"},"pages/tutorials/React & Webpack.html":{"url":"pages/tutorials/React & Webpack.html","title":"리액트 & 웹팩","keywords":"","body":"이 가이드에서는 TypeScript를 React와 webpack으로 묶는 방법을 가르쳐줄 것입니다.\n새로운 프로젝트를 시작하려면 먼저 React Quick Start guide를 살펴보세요.\n그렇지 않으면 npm과 Node.js를 이미 사용하고 있다고 가정합니다.\n프로젝트 배치 (Lay out the project)\n새로운 디렉토리부터 시작합시다. 지금은 이름을 proj로 지정했지만 원하는대로 변경할 수 있습니다.\nmkdir proj\ncd proj\n\n시작하려면 다음과 같은 방식으로 프로젝트를 구성해야합니다:\nproj/\n├─ dist/\n└─ src/\n   └─ components/\n\nTypeScript 파일은 src 폴더에서 시작한 TypeScript는 컴파일 후 webpack을 실행하여 dist의 bundle.js 파일로 끝납니다.작성된 모든 구성 요소는src / components 폴더에 들어갑니다.\n이것을 골격으로 합니다:\nmkdir src\ncd src\nmkdir components\ncd ..\n\nWebpack은 결국 dist 디렉토리를 생성할 것입니다.\n프로젝트 초기화 (Initialize the project)\n이제 이 폴더를 npm 패키지로 바꿀 것입니다.\nnpm init\n\n주의사항이 표시되지만 기본값을 자유롭게 사용할 수 있습니다.사용자를 위해 생성된 package.json 파일에서 언제든 기본값을 변경할 수 있습니다.\n의존성 설치 (Install our dependencies)\n먼저 Webpack이 글로벌으로 설치되어 있는지 확인해보세요.\nnpm install -g webpack\n\nWebpack은 사용자의 코드를 번들(묶어서)로 제공하고 선택적으로 모든 의존성을 단 하나의 .js 파일로 번들링(묶는)하는 도구입니다.\n이제 React와 React-DOM을 package.json 파일의 의존성으로 추가하겠습니다:\nnpm install --save react react-dom @types/react @types/react-dom\n\n@types/ 접두사는 React와 React-DOM을 위한 선언 파일을 가져온다는 것을 의미합니다.일반적으로 \"react\"와 같은 경로를 가져 오면 react 패키지 자체를 살펴봅니다.그러나 모든 패키지가 선언 파일을 포함하는 것은 아니므로 TypeScript는 또한 @types/react 패키지를 찾습니다.나중에는 이 일에 대해 생각할 필요도 없다는 걸 알게 될 것입니다.\n다음으로 awesome-typescript-loader와 source-map-loader에 development-time 의존성을 추가할 것입니다.\nnpm install --save-dev typescript awesome-typescript-loader source-map-loader\n\n이러한 의존성 둘 다 TypeScript와 webpack이 함께 잘 작동하도록 할 것 입니다.awesome-typescript-loader는 Webpack이 TypeScript의 표준 구성 파일 tsconfig.json을 사용하여 TypeScript 코드를 컴파일하는 데 도움이 됩니다.source-map-loader는 TypeScript의 모든 소스 맵 출력을 사용하여 자체 소스 맵을 생성 할 때 webpack에 알립니다.이렇게하면 원래 TypeScript 소스 코드를 디버깅 하듯이 최종 출력 파일을 디버깅 할 수 있습니다.\nawesome-typescript-loader가 typescript의 유일한 로더는 아닙니다.대신 ts-loader를 사용할 수 있습니다.여기에서  두 로더 사이의 차이점에 대해 읽어보세요.\n개발 의존성으로 TypeScript를 설치했음을 주목하십시오.TypeScript를 npm link typescript로 글로벌 사본에 연결할 수 있었는데 이것은 흔치 않은 경우입이다.\nTypeScript 설정 파일 추가 (Add a TypeScript configuration file)\nTypeScript 파일을 함께 가져오고 싶다면 필요한 선언 파일뿐만 아니라 작성할 코드 모두 작성하세요.\n이렇게 하려면 모든 컴파일 설정과 함께 입력 파일 목록이 포함된 tsconfig.json을 생성해야 합니다.프로젝트 루트에 tsconfig.json이라는 이름의 새 파일을 만들고 내용을 다음과 같이 채우기만 하면 됩니다:\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"outDir\": \"./dist/\",\n        \"sourceMap\": true,\n        \"noImplicitAny\": true,\n        \"module\": \"commonjs\",\n        \"target\": \"es5\",\n        \"jsx\": \"react\"\n    },\n    \"include\": [\n        \"./src/**/*\"\n    ]\n}\n\ntsconfig.json 파일에 대한 자세한 내용은 여기를 참조하십시오.\n몇 가지 코드 작성 (Write some code)\nReact를 사용하여 첫 번째 TypeScript 파일을 작성해 보겠습니다.먼저src/components에 Hello.tsx라는 이름의 파일을 만들고 다음과 같이 작성합니다:\nimport * as React from \"react\";\n\nexport interface HelloProps { compiler: string; framework: string; }\n\nexport const Hello = (props: HelloProps) => Hello from {props.compiler} and {props.framework}!;\n\n이 예제에서는 stateless functional components를 사용하는 경우에 대비하여 예제를 좀 더 고급스럽게 만들 수도 있습니다.\nimport * as React from \"react\";\n\nexport interface HelloProps { compiler: string;

Array:\nlet list: Array = [1, 2, 3];\n\n튜플 (Tuple)\n튜플 타입은 고정된 개수의 요소 타입을 알고 있지만 반드시 같을 필요는 없는 배열을 표현할 수 있도록 합니다.예를 들어, 다음과 같은 string과 number의 쌍으로 값을 나타낼 수 있습니다 :\n// 튜플 타입 선언\nlet x: [string, number];\n// 초기화\nx = [\"hello\", 10]; // 좋아요\n// 부정확한 초기화\nx = [10, \"hello\"]; // 오류\n\n알려진 인덱스을 사용하여 요소에 접근하는 경우에 올바른 타입이 검색됩니다.\nconsole.log(x[0].substr(1)); // 좋아요\nconsole.log(x[1].substr(1)); // 오류, 'number'은 'substr'을 가지고 있지 않습니다.\n\n알려진 인덱스 집합 외부의 요소에 접근할 때는 다음과 같이 Union 타입이 사용됩니다:\nx[3] = \"world\"; // 좋아요, 'string'은 'string | number'에 할당될 수 있습니다.\n\nconsole.log(x[5].toString()); // 좋아요, 'string' 및 'number'에 모두 'toString'이 있습니다.\n\nx[6] = true; // 오류, 'boolean'은 'string | number' 타입이 아닙니다.\n\n유니온 타입은 다음 장에서 다루게 될 고급 주제입니다.\n열거 (Enum)\nJavaScript의 표준 데이터 타입 집합에 추가할 수 있는 유용하고 부가적인 추가 자료는 enum 입니다.C#와 같은 언어에서처럼 enum은 numeric 값 집합에 더 친숙한 이름을 부여하는 방법이다.\nenum Color {Red, Green, Blue}\nlet c: Color = Color.Green;\n\n기본적으로 enums는 0부터 시작하는 자신의 멤버 번호를 매기기를 시작합니다.멤버 중 하나의 값을 수동으로 설정하여 이를 변경할 수 있습니다.예를 들어 이전 예제를 0 대신 1로 시작할 수 있습니다:\nenum Color {Red = 1, Green, Blue}\nlet c: Color = Color.Green;\n\n또는 열거 형의 모든 값을 수동으로 설정합니다:\nenum Color {Red = 1, Green = 2, Blue = 4}\nlet c: Color = Color.Green;\n\nenum의 편리한 기능은 숫자 값에서 enum의 해당 값 이름으로 이동할 수 있다는 것입니다.예를 들어, 값 2를 가지고 있지만 위의 Color enum에서 매핑된 값이 무엇인지 확실하지 않은 경우에 그에 상응하는 이름을 찾을 수 있습니다:\nenum Color {Red = 1, Green, Blue}\nlet colorName: string = Color[2];\n\nalert(colorName); // 위의 값이 2 이므로 'Green'을 표시합니다.\n\nAny\n어플리케이션을 작성할 때 알지 못하는 변수의 타입을 설명해야 할 수도 있습니다.이러한 값은 사용자 또는 써드-파티 라이브러리와 같은 동적 컨텐츠에서 비롯될 수 있습니다.이러한 경우에는, 타입 검사를 선택하지 않고 그 값이 컴파일-타임 검사를 통과하도록 하고 싶습니다.이를 위해 다음과 같은 any 타입으로 지정합니다.\nlet notSure: any = 4;\nnotSure = \"문자열일수도 있다\";\nnotSure = false; // 좋아요, 확실한 boolean\n\nany 타입은 기존 JavaScript로 작업할 수 있는 강력한 방법으로 컴파일 과정에서 타입 검사를 점진적으로 실행 (opt-in) 및 중지(opt-out) 할 수 있습니다.\n다른 언어와 마찬가지로 객체도 비슷한 역할을 할 것으로 예상할 수 있습니다.그러나 객체 타입의 변수를 사용하면 해당 객체에는 값만 할당할 수 있습니다 - 실제로 존재하는 것도 임의의 메소드를 호출할 수는 없습니다:\nlet notSure: any = 4;\nnotSure.ifItExists(); // 좋아요, 런타임에 ifItExists가 존재할 수 있습니다.\nnotSure.toFixed(); // 좋아요, toFixed는 존재합니다. (그러나 컴파일러는 체크하지 않습니다)\n\nlet prettySure: Object = 4;\nprettySure.toFixed(); // 오류: 'Object' 타입에 'toFixed' 프로퍼티는 존재하지 않습니다.\n\nany 타입은 일부를 알고 있는 경우에도 유용하지만 모두 그렇지는 않습니다.예를 들어 배열이 있지만 배열에는 다른 타입이 혼재되어 있습니다:\nlet list: any[] = [1, true, \"free\"];\n\nlist[1] = 100;\n\nVoid\nvoid는 any의 정반대이지만 조금 비슷합니다: 어떠한 타입의 부재도 전혀 없습니다.일반적으로 반환 값을 반환하지 않는 함수의 반환 타입으로 볼 수 있습니다:\nfunction warnUser(): void {\n    alert(\"This is my warning message\");\n}\n\nvoid 타입의 변수 선언은 undefined 또는 null 만 할당할 수 있으므로 유용하지 않습니다:\nlet unusable: void = undefined;\n\nNull 과 Undefined\nTypeScript에서 undefined와 null은 실제로 각기 undefined와 null이라는 자체적인 타입을 가집니다.void와 마찬가지로 그것들은 매우(극단적으로) 유용하지 않습니다 :\n// 그 외에도 이러한 변수에 할당할 수 있습니다!\nlet u: undefined = undefined;\nlet n: null = null;\n\n기본적으로 null과 undefined는 다른 모든 타입의 서브 타입입니다.즉 null과 undefined를 number와 같은 것으로 할당 할 수 있습니다.\n그러나 --strictNullChecks 플래그를 사용할 때 null과 undefined는 void와 그 각각의 타입에만 할당할 수 있습니다.이렇게 하면 많은 일반적인 오류를 피할 수 있습니다.string 또는 null 또는 undefined 중 하나를 전달하고자 하는 경우 string | null | undefined (union 타입)을 사용할 수 있습니다.다시 한 번 말하자면 이후에 더 많은 Union 타입에 관한 내용이 있습니다.\n\n메모: 가능한 한 --strictNullChecks 검사를 사용하도록 권장하지만 본 핸드북의 목적상 이 기능이 꺼져 있다고 가정하겠습니다.\n\nNever\nnever 타입은 절대로 발생하지 않는 값의 타입을 나타냅니다.예를 들어 never는 함수 표현식의 반환 타입이거나 항상 예외를 던지는 화살표 함수 표현식이거나 절대 반환하지 않는 표현식입니다.변수는 또한 never 일 때 타입 가드에 의해 좁혀지더라도 결코 사실일 수 없으며 타입을 획득하지 못합니다.\nnever 타입은 모든 타입의 서브 타입이며 모든 타입에 할당할 수 있습니다.어떤 타입도 never의 서브 타입이거나 할당 가능한 타입은 아닙니다 (never 자체를 제외하고).any 조차도 never에 할당할 수 없습니다.\nnever를 반환하는 함수의 몇 가지 예는 다음과 같습니다 :\n// 반환되는 함수에는 연결할 수 없는 end-point가 있어서는 안 됩니다.\nfunction error(message: string): never {\n    throw new Error(message);\n}\n\n// 추론되는 반환 타입은 절대로 없습니다.\nfunction fail() {\n    return error(\"Something failed\");\n}\n\n// 반환되는 함수에는 연결할 수 없는 end-point가 있어서는 안 됩니다.\nfunction infiniteLoop(): never {\n    while (true) {\n    }\n}\n\n타입 단언 (Type assertions)\n때로는 TypeScript보다 더 많은 값을 알아야 하는 상황에 놓일 수도 있습니다.일반적으로 이 문제는 일부 엔티티의 타입이 현재 타입보다 더 구체적일 수 있다는 것을 알고 있을 때 발생합니다.\nType assertions 은 컴파일러에게 \"나를 믿어, 내가 하고 있는 일을 안다\"라고 말하는 방법입니다.type assertion은 다른 언어의 형 변환(타입캐스팅)과 비슷하지만 특별한 검사나 데이터를 재구성하지는 않습니다.런타임에 영향을 미치지 않으며 컴파일러에서만 사용됩니다.TypeScript는 개발자가 필요한 특별한 검사를 수행했다고 가정합니다.\nType assertions은 두 가지 형태를 가집니다.하나는 \"angle-bracket\" (꺾쇠괄호) 구문입니다:\nlet someValue: any = \"this is a string\";\n\nlet strLength: number = (someValue).length;\n\n그리고 다른 하나는 구문은 as 입니다 :\nlet someValue: any = \"this is a string\";\n\nlet strLength: number = (someValue as string).length;\n\n두 샘플은 동일합니다.다른 하나를 사용하는 것은 주로 선호도에 따른 선택입니다.그러나 TypeScript를 JSX와 함께 사용할 때는 as 스타일의 단언만 허용됩니다.\nlet에 대한 메모\n지금까지 우리가 알고 있는 JavaScript의 var 키워드 대신 let 키워드를 사용했음을 알 수 있습니다.\nlet 키워드는 실제로 TypeScript에서 사용할 수 있는 더욱 새로운 JavaScript 구문입니다.나중에 더 자세히 논의하겠지만 JavaScript가 가지고 있는 많은 흔한 문제들은 let의 사용으로 해결할 수 있기 때문에 가능할 때마다 var 대신 let을 사용하는 것이 좋습니다.\n"},"pages/Variable Declarations.html":{"url":"pages/Variable Declarations.html","title":"변수 선언","keywords":"","body":"소개 (Introduction)\nlet과 const는 JavaScript에서 상대적으로 새로운 두 가지 유형의 변수 선언입니다.이전에 언급했듯이 let은 var와 유사하지만 사용자가 JavaScript로 실행하는 일반적인 \"결함\"을 피할 수 있습니다.const는 변수에 재 할당 할 수 없다는 점에서 let의 기능 확장입니다.\nTypeScript가 JavaScript의 상위 집합이기 때문에 자연스럽게 let과 const를 지원합니다.여기서 우리는 이 새로운 선언들에 대해 더 자세히 설명할 것이고 왜 그것들이 var보다 더 바람직한지를 자세히 설명 할 것입니다.\n만약 JavaScript를 아무렇게나 사용했다면 다음 섹션은 기억을 새롭게 하는 좋은 방법이 될 것입니다.JavaScript에서 var 선언의 모든 단점을 잘 알고 있다면 더 쉽게 건너뛸 수 있습니다.\nvar 선언 (var declarations)\n전통적으로 JavaScript에서 변수 선언은 var 키워드를 사용하였습니다.\nvar a = 10;\n\n알다시피 방금 a 변수의 값을 10 으로 선언하였습니다.\n또한 함수 내에서 변수를 선언할 수도 있습니다.\nfunction f() {\n    var message = \"Hello, world!\";\n\n    return message;\n}\n\n그리고 다른 함수 내부의 동일한 변수에 접근이 가능합니다.\nfunction f() {\n    var a = 10;\n    return function g() {\n        var b = a + 1;\n        return b;\n    }\n}\n\nvar g = f();\ng(); // 오류 '11'\n\n위의 예제에서 g함수는 f함수에서 선언된 변수 a를 흭득하였습니다.\ng함수가 호출되는 시점에 a의 값은 f함수 내에 a의 값에 연결됩니다.\nf함수가 실행되는 시점에 g함수가 호출되더라도 a에 접근하여 수정할 수 있습니다.\nfunction f() {\n    var a = 1;\n\n    a = 2;\n    var b = g();\n    a = 3;\n\n    return b;\n\n    function g() {\n        return a;\n    }\n}\n\nf(); // '2' 반환\n\n스코프 규칙 (Scoping rules)\nvar 선언은 다른 언어의 스코프 규칙에 비해 이상한 스코프 규칙이 몇가지 있습니다.다음 예를 함께 보겠습니다.\nfunction f(shouldInitialize: boolean) {\n    if (shouldInitialize) {\n        var x = 10;\n    }\n\n    return x;\n}\n\nf(true);  // '10' 반환\nf(false); // 'undefined' 반환\n\n어떤 독자는 이 예제를 두 번 실행해 볼 수도 있습니다.변수 x는 if 블록 내에 선언되어 있지만 블록의 바깥에서 접근할 수 있습니다.var 선언은 함수, 모듈, 네임 스페이스 또는 전역 스코프에서 접근할 수 있기 때문에 가능합니다.-포함된 블록에 관계없이 나중에 모두 다룰 것입니다.이것을 var-scoping 또는 function-scoping이라고 부릅니다.매개변수 또한 함수의 스코프입니다.\n이러한 스코프 규칙은 몇 가지 유형의 실수를 유발할 수 있습니다.그들이 악화시키는 한가지 문제점은 동일한 변수를 여러 번 선언하는 것은 실수가 아니라는 사실입니다.\nfunction sumMatrix(matrix: number[][]) {\n    var sum = 0;\n    for (var i = 0; i \n어쩌면 다소 쉽게 찾을 수도 있지만 for-loop 내에서 동일한 함수 스코프의 변수를 참조하기 때문에 실수로 변수 i 를 덮어 쓰게 됩니다.숙련된 개발자들은 알겠지만 비슷한 종류의 버그는 코드 리뷰에서 끝없는 좌절의 원인이 될 수 있다.\n변수 캡쳐링의 단점 (Variable capturing quirks)\n잠깐 다음 코드의 출력을 예상을 해보세요\nfor (var i = 0; i \n익숙하지 않은 사람들을 위해 setTimeout은 일정한 시간이 지나면 함수를 실행하려고 합니다.(실행이 멈추는 것을 기다리고 있습니다.)\n준비됐나요? 보세요:\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n\n많은 JavaScript 개발자들은 이러한 동작에 친숙하지만 당신은 놀랐을 수도 있습니다.하지만 당신은 확실히 혼자가 아닙니다.\n대부분의 사람들은 이러한 결과를 기대합니다.\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\n앞에서 변수 캡쳐링에 대해 언급한 내용 기억하세요?setTimeout에 전달하는 모든 함수 표현식은 실제로 동일한 스코프의 i를 참조합니다.\n이것이 무슨 뜻인지 한번 생각해 봅시다.setTimeout은 몇 밀리 초 후에 함수를 실행하지만 for 루프가 실행을 중지 한 후에 만 실행됩니다.for 루프가 실행을 중지했을 때 i 값은 10입니다. 따라서 주어진 함수가 호출될 때마다 10을 출력합니다!\n일반적인 해결 방법은 각 반복마다 i를 캡쳐하는 즉시 실행 함수 표현식인 IIFE를 사용하는 것입니다.\nfor (var i = 0; i \n위의 이상하게 생긴 패턴은 매우 일반적입니다.매개 변수 목록의 i는 for루프에 선언된 i와 같지만 동일한 네이밍을 했기 때문에 루프를 변경할 필요가 없었습니다.\nlet 선언 (let declarations)\n이제는 var에 몇 가지 문제가 있다는 것을 알아냈습니다.그 이유는 정확히 let이 도입 된 이유입니다.let은 var와 동일한 방식으로 작성됩니다.\nlet hello = \"Hello!\";\n\n중요한 차이점은 구문에 있는 것이 아니라 의미에 관한 것입니다.이제 이 내용을 살펴 보겠습니다.\n블록-스코프 (Block-scoping)\nlet을 사용하여 변수를 선언할 때 렉시컬-스코프 또는 블록-스코프를 사용합니다.스코프가 포함된 함수로 누출되는 var 변수와 달리 블록-스코프 변수는 가장 가깝게 포함된 블록 또는 for 반복문 외부에서 사용할 수 없습니다.\nfunction f(input: boolean) {\n    let a = 100;\n\n    if (input) {\n        // 'a'는 이곳에서 가능\n        let b = a + 1;\n        return b;\n    }\n\n    // 오류: 'b'는 여기에 존재하지 않습니다.\n    return b;\n}\n\n여기 두 개의 지역변수 a와 b가 있습니다.a의 스코프는 함수 f의 지역변수로 제한되어있고 b의 스코프는 if문 블록에 제한되어있습니다.\ncatch 문안에 선언된 변수에도 유사한 스코프의 스코프 규칙을 갖습니다.\ntry {\n    throw \"oh no!\";\n}\ncatch (e) {\n    console.log(\"Oh well.\");\n}\n\n// 오류: 'e'는 여기에 존재하지 않습니다.\nconsole.log(e);\n\n블록-스코프 변수의 또 다른 프로퍼티는 실제로 선언되기 전에는 읽거나 쓸 수 없다는 것입니다.이러한 변수는 스코프내에서 temporal dead zone 이 될 때까지 \"존재\"합니다.이것은 let 선언 이전에 변수에 먼저 접근 할수 없는 정교한 방법이며 다행스럽게도 TypeScript를 통해 알 수 있습니다.\na++; // 'a'를 선언하기전에 사용하는것은 불법입니다;\nlet a;\n\n주의해야 할 점은 블록-스코프 변수가 선언되기 전에 변수를 캡쳐할 수 있다는 것입니다.선언전에 해당 함수을 실행시키는 것은 불법이라는 것을 알 수 있습니다.\nES2015를 목표로 한다면 현대적인 런타임은 오류를 던질 것입니다.그러나 지금은 TypeScripts는 허용되며 오류로 보고하지 않습니다.\nfunction foo() {\n    // 'a'를 캡쳐합니다\n    return a;\n}\n\n// 잘못된 호출로 'foo'가 선언되기 전에 'a'가 선언됩니다.\n// 여기서 런타임 오류가 발생해야합니다.\nfoo();\n\nlet a;\n\nTemporal dead zone 에 대한 자세한 내용은 Mozilla 개발자 네트워크 의 관련 내용을 참조하십시오.\n재선언과 Shadowing (Re-declarations and Shadowing)\nvar 를 선언한 횟수가 중요하지 않다고 언급했습니다. 단지 변수를 하나 얻었을 뿐입니다.\nfunction f(x) {\n    var x;\n    var x;\n\n    if (true) {\n        var x;\n    }\n}\n\n위의 예에서 x의 모든 선언은 실제로 동일한 x를 참조하며 이는 완전히 유효합니다.이것은 종종 버그의 원인이 됩니다. 고맙게도 let 에서는 이런 것을 허용하지 않습니다.\nlet x = 10;\nlet x = 20; // 오류: 동일한 스코프에서 'x'를 다시 선언 할 수 없습니다.\n\nTypeScript의 블록-스코프는 두개의 같은 변수는 필요하지 않다고 우리에게 문제를 말해줍니다.\nfunction f(x) {\n    let x = 100; // 오류: 매개변수가 변수 선언에 간섭하고 있습니다.\n}\n\nfunction g() {\n    let x = 100;\n    var x = 100; // 오류: 'x'의 선언을 두 번 할 수 없습니다.\n}\n\n블록-스코프 변수가 함수-스코프 변수로 선언될 수 없다는 뜻은 아닙니다.블록-스코프 변수는 명확하게 다른 블록 내에서 선언되어야합니다.\nfunction f(condition, x) {\n    if (condition) {\n        let x = 100;\n        return x;\n    }\n\n    return x;\n}\n\nf(false, 0); // '0' 반환\nf(true, 0);  // '100' 반환\n\n중첩된 스코프에서 기존의 변수 이름을 사용하는 것을 shadowing 이라고 합니다. shadowing 은 우발적인 버그를 유발하는 동시에 버그를 예방할 수도 있다는 점에서 양날의 검입니다.\n예를 들어 let 변수를 사용하여 이전 sumMatrix 함수를 작성했다고 가정해 보겠습니다.\nfunction sumMatrix(matrix: number[][]) {\n    let sum = 0;\n    for (let i = 0; i \n이번 버전의 루프는 내부의 반복문의 i가 외부의 반복문의 i를 shadows하기때문에 실제로 계산을 합니다.\nShadowing은 보통 더 명확한 코드를 작성하기 위해 피해야 합니다.이를 활용할 수 있는 몇 가지 시나리오가 있을 수 있지만 최선의 판단을 내려야 합니다.\n블럭-스코프 변수 캡쳐\nvar 선언으로 변수 캡쳐를 처음 접했을 때 우리는 일단 캡쳐된 변수가 어떻게 작동하는지 간략하게 살펴보았습니다.이것에 대한 직감적이고 더 나은 직감을 주기 위해 스코프가 실행될 때마다 변수의 \"환경\"을 생성합니다.해당 환경 및 캡쳐 된 변수는 스코프 내의 모든 항목이 완료된 후에도 존재할 수 있습니다\nfunction theCityThatAlwaysSleeps() {\n    let getCity;\n\n    if (true) {\n        let city = \"Seattle\";\n        getCity = function() {\n            return city;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return getCity();\n}\n\n환경내에서 city를 캡쳐했으므로 if 블록이 실행을 완료 했음에도 불구하고 여전히 접근할 수 있습니다.\n이전의 setTimeout 예제에서 for 문을 반복할 때마다 변수의 상태를 캡쳐하기 위해 IIFE를 사용해야한다는 결론을 얻었습니다.실제로 하고 있던 것은 캡쳐한 변수를 위한 새로운 변수 환경을 만드는 것이었습니다.그것은 약간의 고통이었지만 다행스럽게도 TypeScript에서 그렇게 할 필요가 없습니다.\nlet은 루프의 일부로 선언될 때 크게 다른 동작을 합니다.루프 자체에 새로운 환경을 도입하기보다는 이러한 선언은 반복마다 새로운 스코프를 만듭니다.이것이 IIFE로 하고 있었던 것을 let 을 사용하여 이전의 setTimeout 예제를 바꿀 수 있습니다.\nfor (let i = 0; i \n예상한대로 출력됩니다.\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\nconst 선언 (const declarations)\nconst 는 변수를 선언하는 또 다른 방법입니다.\nconst numLivesForCat = 9;\n\n그것은 let 선언과 같지만 그 이름에서 알 수 있듯이 바인딩 된 후에는 값을 변경할 수 없습니다.즉 let과 동일한 스코프 규칙을 가지고 있지만 규칙을 다시 할당할 수 없습니다.\n이것은 참조하는 값이 불변 이라는 개념과 혼동되어서는 안됩니다.\nconst numLivesForCat = 9;\nconst kitty = {\n    name: \"Aurora\",\n    numLives: numLivesForCat,\n}\n\n// 오류\nkitty = {\n    name: \"Danielle\",\n    numLives: numLivesForCat\n};\n\n// 모두 \"좋아요\"\nkitty.name = \"Rory\";\nkitty.name = \"Kitty\";\nkitty.name = \"Cat\";\nkitty.numLives--;\n\n이를 방지하기 위해 구체적인 조치를 취하지 않는 한 const변수의 내부 상태는 여전히 수정할 수 있습니다. 다행히 TypeScript를 사용하면 객체의 멤버를 readonly로 지정할 수 있습니다.\nInterfaces 챕터에서 자세한 내용을 다룹니다.\nlet vs. const\n비슷한 스코프 지정 의미론을 가진 두 가지 선언이 있다고 가정할 때 어떤 것을 사용할 것인지를 묻는 것은 당연합니다.대부분의 질문들과 같이 그 대답도 다음과 같습니다: 그것은 다릅니다.\nprinciple of least privilege (최소 권한 원칙) 적용하면 수정할 권한을 제외한 모든 선언은 'const'를 사용해야 합니다.\n근본적인 이유는 변수를 쓸 필요가 없는 경우 동일한 코드 베이스에서 작업하는 다른 사용자가 자동으로 객체에 쓸 수 없으므로 변수에 재할당 할 필요가 있는지 여부를 고려해야 합니다.\n또한 const를 사용하면 데이터 흐름을 추론할 때 코드를 더 예측 가능하게 만들 수 있습니다.최선을 판단을 하여 해당되는 경우 팀원들과 이 문제를 상의하십시오.\n이 handbook 의 경우 대부분 let 선언을 사용합니다.\n비구조화 (Destructuring)\nTypeScript에 있는 또 다른 ECMAScript2015 기능은 비구조화입니다.전체 참조 정보는 Mozilla Developer Network의 기사를 참조하세요.이 섹션에서는 간단한 개요를 제공합니다.\n배열 비구조화 (Array destructuring)\n가장 간단한 구조 해체 방법은 배열 비구조화 할당입니다.\nlet input = [1, 2];\nlet [first, second] = input;\nconsole.log(first); // 1 출력\nconsole.log(second); // 2 출력\n\n이것은 first와 second라는 두 개의 새로운 변수를 만듭니다.\n이는 인덱스를 사용하는 것과 동일하지만 훨씬 편리합니다.\nfirst = input[0];\nsecond = input[1];\n\n비구조화는 이미 선언된 변수에서도 작동합니다.\n// 변수 교환\n[first, second] = [second, first];\n\n함수에 대한 매개 변수가 있는 경우\nfunction f([first, second]: [number, number]) {\n    console.log(first);\n    console.log(second);\n}\nf([1, 2]);\n\n... 구문을 사용하여 목록의 나머지 항목에 대한 변수를 생성할 수 있습니다.\nlet [first, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4];\nconsole.log(first); // 1 출력\nconsole.log(rest); // [ 2, 3, 4 ] 출력\n\n물론 이것은 JavaScript이므로 관심이 없는 후행 요소는 무시할 수 있습니다.\nlet [first] = [1, 2, 3, 4];\nconsole.log(first); // 1 출력\n\n또는 다른 요소들 :\nlet [, second, , fourth] = [1, 2, 3, 4];\n\n객체 비구조화 (Object destructuring)\n또한 객체를 해체할 수 있습니다.\nlet o = {\n    a: \"foo\",\n    b: 12,\n    c: \"bar\"\n};\nlet { a, b } = o;\n\n이것은 o.a와 o.b에서 새로운 변수 a와 b를 생성합니다. 필요없는 경우 c를 건너뛸 수 있습니다.\n배열 비구조화처럼 선언없이 할당 수 있습니다.\n({ a, b } = { a: \"baz\", b: 101 });\n\n이 문장을 괄호로 묶어야한다는 것을 주목하십시오.JavaScript는 일반적으로 a{를 블록 시작으로 파싱합니다.\n... 구문을 사용하여 객체의 나머지 항목에 대한 변수를 만들 수 있습니다\nlet { a, ...passthrough } = o;\nlet total = passthrough.b + passthrough.c.length;\n\n프로퍼티 이름 변경 (Property renaming)\n프로퍼티의 이름 또한 다름 이름으로 지정할 수 있습니다.\nlet { a: newName1, b: newName2 } = o;\n\n문장이 혼란스러워지기 시작했습니다.\na : newName1를 \"a as newName1\"로 읽을 수 있습니다.\n방향은 왼쪽에서 오른쪽으로 사용합니다.\nlet newName1 = o.a;\nlet newName2 = o.b;\n\n혼란스럽겠지만 여기서 콜론은 타입을 나타내는 콜론은 아닙니다.형식을 지정하는 경우 전체 형식이 비구조화된 후에도 형식을 작성해야 합니다.\nlet { a, b }: { a: string, b: number } = o;\n\n기본값 (Default values)\n기본값을 사용하면 프로퍼티가 정의되지 않은 경우의 기본값을 지정할 수 있습니다.\nfunction keepWholeObject(wholeObject: { a: string, b?: number }) {\n    let { a, b = 1001 } = wholeObject;\n}\n\nkeepWholeObject 함수는 b가 정의되지 않더라도 a와 b 프로퍼티뿐만 아니라 wholeObject의 변수를 가집니다.\n함수 선언 (Function declarations)\n비구조화는 함수 선언에서도 작동합니다.간단한 예를 보겠습니다.\ntype C = { a: string, b?: number }\nfunction f({ a, b }: C): void {\n    // ...\n}\n\n그러나 매개 변수에 대해 기본값을 지정하는 것이 더 일반적이며 비구조화시 기본값을 가져오는 것은 까다로울 수 있습니다.\n우선 기본값 앞에 패턴을 두는 것을 기억해야 합니다.\nfunction f({ a, b } = { a: \"\", b: 0 }): void {\n    // ...\n}\nf(); // 좋아요, 기본값 { a: \"\", b: 0 }\n\n\n위의 코드는 나중에 handbook에서 설명할 유형 추론의 한 예제입니다.\n\n그런 다음 기본 초기화가 아닌 비구조화 프로퍼티에 대한 선택적인 프로퍼티를 기본값으로 지정한다는 것을 기억해야 합니다.c에서 b는 선택사항으로 지정되었다는 것을 기억하세요.\nfunction f({ a, b = 0 } = { a: \"\" }): void {\n    // ...\n}\nf({ a: \"yes\" }); // 좋아요, 기본값 b = 0\nf(); // 좋아요, 기본값은 { a:\"\" }이며 이 경우 기본값은 b = 0입니다.\nf({}); // 오류, 인수를 제공하려면 'a'가 필요합니다.\n\n비구조화를 조심히 사용하세요.앞의 예제에서 보여 주듯이 가장 단순한 비구조화 표현식을 제외하고는 혼란스럽습니다.이름 바꾸기 기본값 및 타입을 주석으로 써놓지 않고는 이해하기 힘든 깊은 형태를 비구조화하는 것은 특히 그렇습니다.\n비구조화 표현식은 작고 심플하게 유지하세요.\n직접 생성한 비구조화를 항상 스스로 쓸 수 있어야 합니다.\n전개 연산자 (Spread)\n전개는 비구조화의 반대입니다.배열을 다른 배열로 객체를 다른 객체로 전개하는 것을 허용합니다.\n예를 들어:\nlet first = [1, 2];\nlet second = [3, 4];\nlet bothPlus = [0, ...first, ...second, 5];\n\n이것은 bothPlus에 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]값을 부여합니다.전개는 first와 second의 얕은 복사본을 만듭니다. 그들은 전개에 의해 변하지 않습니다.\n또한 객체를 전개 할 수도 있습니다.\nlet defaults = { food: \"spicy\", price: \"$$\", ambiance: \"noisy\" };\nlet search = { ...defaults, food: \"rich\" };\n\n현재 search의 값은 { food: \"rich\", price: \"$$\", ambiance: \"noisy\" }입니다.객체의 전개는 배열의 전개보다 복잡합니다.배열은 전개를 왼쪽에서 오른쪽으로 진행하지만 결과는 여전히 객체입니다.이것은 나중에 전개한 객체의 프로퍼티가 이전에 있던 프로퍼티를 덮어씁니다.따라서 끝에 전개할 이전의 코드를 수정하면 다음과 같습니다.\nlet defaults = { food: \"spicy\", price: \"$$\", ambiance: \"noisy\" };\nlet search = { food: \"rich\", ...defaults };\n\ndefaults의 food속성을 food: \"rich\"로 덮어쓰는데 우리는 이것을 원한 게 아닙니다.\n객체 Spread에는 몇 가지 다른 놀라운 한계가 있습니다.\n첫번째, 열거 가능 속성(own, enumerable properties) 객체에 포함됩니다.기본적으로 객체의 인스턴스를 전개할 때 메서드를 잃어버린다는 것을 의미합니다.\nclass C {\n  p = 12;\n  m() {\n  }\n}\nlet c = new C();\nlet clone = { ...c };\nclone.p; // 좋아요\nclone.m(); // 오류!\n\n두번째, Typescript 컴파일러는 일반 함수의 매개변수를 전개로 허용하지 않습니다.이 기능은 향후 버전의 언어에서 사용될 것으로 예상됩니다.\n"},"pages/Interfaces.html":{"url":"pages/Interfaces.html","title":"인터페이스","keywords":"","body":"소개 (Introduction)\nTypeScript의 핵심 원리 중 하나는 값이 가지는 형태 에 초점을 맞추는 타입-체킹을 한다는 것입니다.이것은 때때로 \"덕 타이핑(duck typing)\" 또는 \"구조적 하위 유형화(structural subtyping)\"라고도 합니다.TypeScript에서는 인터페이스가 이러한 타입의 이름을 지정하는 역할을 하며 코드 내에서 계약을 정의하고 프로젝트 외부에서 코드를 사용하는 계약을 정의하는 강력한 방법입니다.\n첫번째 인터페이스 (Our First Interface)\n인터페이스의 작동 방식을 확인하는 가장 쉬운 방법은 간단한 예를 들어 시작하는 것입니다:\nfunction printLabel(labelledObj: { label: string }) {\n    console.log(labelledObj.label);\n}\n\nlet myObj = {size: 10, label: \"Size 10 Object\"};\nprintLabel(myObj);\n\n타입-체커는 printLabel에 대한 호출을 확인합니다.PrintLabel 함수에는 객체를 전달하는 데 필요한 단일 매개변수가 있으며 이는 문자열 타입의 label 프로퍼티를 가집니다.실제로 객체는 이보다 더 많은 프로퍼티를 가지고 있지만 컴파일러는 필요한 속성이 최소한 있고 필요한 타입과 일치하는지만 검사합니다.TypeScript가 그렇게 관대하지 않은 경우도 있습니다. 이에 대해 좀 더 자세히 다룰 것입니다.\n이번에도 인터페이스를 사용하여 문자열 타입인 label 프로퍼티를 가져야 한다는 요구 사항을 설명하는 동일한 예제를 다시 작성할 수 있습니다:\ninterface LabelledValue {\n    label: string;\n}\n\nfunction printLabel(labelledObj: LabelledValue) {\n    console.log(labelledObj.label);\n}\n\nlet myObj = {size: 10, label: \"Size 10 Object\"};\nprintLabel(myObj);\n\n인터페이스 LabelledValue은 이전 예제의 요구 사항을 설명하는 데 사용할 수 있는 이름입니다.여전히 label이라는 문자열 타입의 단일 프로퍼티가 있습니다.printLabel에 전달하는 객체가 다른 언어처럼 이 인터페이스를 구현한다고 명시적으로 말할 필요가 없었습니다.여기서는 중요한 형태일 뿐입니다. 함수로 전달되는 객체가 나열된 요구 사항을 충족하는 경우 허용됩니다.\n타입-체커에서는 이러한 프로퍼티가 순서대로 제공될 것을 요구하지 않으며 다만 인터페이스에 필요한 속성이 있고 필요한 타입만 필요하다는 점을 지적하는 것이 중요합니다.\n선택적 프로퍼티 (Optional Properties)\n인터페이스의 모든 프로퍼티가 필수로 필요할 수는 없습니다.어떤 것들은 특정한 조건 하에 존재하거나 아예 존재하지 않을 수도 있습니다.이러한 선택적 프로퍼티는 프로퍼티 중에서 일부만 채워진 객체를 함수에 전달하는 \"옵션 백(option bags)\"과 같은 패턴을 생성할 때 많이 사용됩니다.\n다음은 이 패턴의 예입니다:\ninterface SquareConfig {\n    color?: string;\n    width?: number;\n}\n\nfunction createSquare(config: SquareConfig): {color: string; area: number} {\n    let newSquare = {color: \"white\", area: 100};\n    if (config.color) {\n        newSquare.color = config.color;\n    }\n    if (config.width) {\n        newSquare.area = config.width * config.width;\n    }\n    return newSquare;\n}\n\nlet mySquare = createSquare({color: \"black\"});\n\n선택적 프로퍼티를 가진 인터페이스는 다른 인터페이스와 유사하게 작성되며 선언된 프로퍼티 이름 끝에 ?로 표시됩니다.\n선택적 프로퍼티의 장점은 사용 가능한 프로퍼티를 설명하는 동시에 인터페이스에 포함되지 않은 프로퍼티의 사용을 방지할 수 있다는 것입니다.\n예를 들어 createSquare에서 color 프로퍼티의 이름을 잘못 입력하면 다음과 같은 오류 메시지가 표시됩니다:\ninterface SquareConfig {\n    color?: string;\n    width?: number;\n}\n\nfunction createSquare(config: SquareConfig): { color: string; area: number } {\n    let newSquare = {color: \"white\", area: 100};\n    if (config.color) {\n        // 오류 : 'SquareConfig' 타입에 'clor'프로퍼티가 존재하지 않습니다. \n        newSquare.color = config.clor;\n    }\n    if (config.width) {\n        newSquare.area = config.width * config.width;\n    }\n    return newSquare;\n}\n\nlet mySquare = createSquare({color: \"black\"});\n\n읽기 전용 프로퍼티 (Readonly properties)\n일부 프로퍼티는 객체를 처음 생성할 때만 수정할 수 있어야 합니다.프로퍼티 이름 앞에 readonly을 붙여 넣어 지정할 수 있습니다:\ninterface Point {\n    readonly x: number;\n    readonly y: number;\n}\n\n객체 리터럴을 할당하여 Point를 구성 할 수 있습니다. 할당 후 x와 y는 바꿀 수 없습니다.\nlet p1: Point = { x: 10, y: 20 };\np1.x = 5; // 오류!\n\nTypeScript에는 모든 변형 메서드가 제거된 Array와 동일한 ReadonlyArray타입이 있으므로 생성 후 배열을 변경하지 말아야 합니다.\nlet a: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4];\nlet ro: ReadonlyArray = a;\nro[0] = 12; // 오류!\nro.push(5); // 오류!\nro.length = 100; // 오류!\na = ro; // 오류!\n\n코드의 마지막 줄에서 전체 ReadonlyArray를 일반적인 배열로 다시 할당하는 것조차도 불법임을 알 수 있습니다.그럼에도 불구하고 타입 단언(assertion)을 통해 오버라이드 할 수 있습니다.\na = ro as number[];\n\nreadonly vs const\nreadonly을 사용할지 아니면 const 사용할지 기억할 수 있는 가장 쉬운 방법은 변수에서 사용할지 또는 프로퍼티에서 사용할지를 묻는 것입니다.변수는 const를 사용하는 반면 프로퍼티는 readonly를 사용합니다.\n프로퍼티 초과 검사 (Excess Property Checks)\n인터페이스를 사용하는 첫 번째 예에서 TypeScript를 사용하면 { size: number; label: string; }을 { label: string; }으로만 예상하는 항목으로 전달할 수 있습니다.또한 선택적 프로퍼티에 대해서 배웠고 그것이 소위 말하는 \"옵션 백(option bags)\"을 설명할 때 어떻게 유용한지도 배웠습니다.\n그러나 두 가지를 결합하는 것은 JavaScript에서와 하고 있는 것과 같은 방식으로 자신의 무덤을 파는 것입니다.예를 들어 createSquare를 사용한 마지막 예제를 봅시다:\ninterface SquareConfig {\n    color?: string;\n    width?: number;\n}\n\nfunction createSquare(config: SquareConfig): { color: string; area: number } {\n    // ...\n}\n\nlet mySquare = createSquare({ colour: \"red\", width: 100 });\n\ncreateSquare의 인수는 color가 아닌 colour 입니다. 보통의 JavaScript에서는 이러한 종류의 작업은 조용히 실패합니다.\nwidth 프로퍼티가 호환되고 color 프로퍼티가 없으며 특별하게 color 프로퍼티가 대수롭지 않기 때문에 이 프로그램이 올바른 타입임을 주장할 수 있습니다.\n그러나 TypeScript는 이 코드에 버그가 있을 수 있음을 나타냅니다.객체 리터럴은 다른 변수에 할당하거나 인수로 전달할 때 특별한 처리를 받아 프로퍼티 초과 검사(Excess Property Checks) 를 거칩니다.객체 리터럴에 \"대상 타입\"에 없는 속성이 있으면 오류가 발생합니다.\n// 오류 : 'colour'는 'SquareConfig' 타입에서 필요하지 않습니다.\nlet mySquare = createSquare({ colour: \"red\", width: 100 });\n\n이런 검사을 하는 것은 실제로 정말 간단합니다.가장 쉬운 방법은 타입 단언(type assertion)을 사용하는 것입니다:\nlet mySquare = createSquare({ width: 100, opacity: 0.5 } as SquareConfig);\n\n하지만 객체에 특별한 방법으로 사용되는 추가 프로퍼티가 있는 것이 확실한 경우 문자열 인덱스 시그니처(string index signature)을 추가하는 것이 더 좋습니다.\nSquareConfig가 위의 타입이 포함되는 color 및 width 프로퍼티가 가질 수 있지만 또 다른 속성도 있는 경우에는 다음과 같이 정의할 수 있습니다.\ninterface SquareConfig {\n    color?: string;\n    width?: number;\n    [propName: string]: any;\n}\n\n이후에 인덱스 시그니처(index signatures)에 대해 이야기하겠지만 SquareConfig은 여러 프로퍼티들을 가질 수 있으며 color 또는  width가 아닌 다른 프로퍼티들의 타입은 문제 되지 않습니다.\n이러한 검사를 하는 마지막 방법 중 하나는 객체를 다른 변수에 할당하는 것입니다: squareOptions은 너무 프로퍼티 초과 검사를 거치지 않기 때문에 컴파일러가 오류를 제공하지 않습니다:\nlet squareOptions = { colour: \"red\", width: 100 };\nlet mySquare = createSquare(squareOptions);\n\n위와 같은 간단한 코드의 경우에는 이러한 검사를 \"회피하는\" 시도를 하지 말아야 합니다.메서드와 상태를 유지하는 더 복잡한 객체 리터럴의 경우 이러한 기법을 유지하고 싶은 마음이겠지만 대부분의 초과 프로퍼티 오류는 실제로 버그입니다.즉 옵션 백(option bags)과 같은 물건에 대해 초과 프로퍼티 검사 문제가 발생하는 경우 타입 선언 중 일부를 수정해야 할 수도 있습니다.createSquare에 color 또는 colour 프로퍼티를 모두 포함한 객체를 전달하는 것이 괜찮은 경우 squareConfig의 정의를 수정해야 합니다.\n함수 타입 (Function Types)\n인터페이스는 JavaScript 객체가 취할 수 있는 다양한 형태을 형성할 수 있습니다.프로퍼티를 가진 객체를 설명하는 것 외에도 인터페이스는 함수 타입을 형성할 수도 있습니다.\n인터페이스가 포함된 함수의 타입을 형성하기 위해 인터페이스에 호출 시그니처(call signature)을 제공합니다.이것은 매개 변수 목록과 반환 타입만 주어진 함수 선언과 같습니다. 매개 변수 목록의 각 매개 변수에는 이름과 타입이 모두 필요합니다.\ninterface SearchFunc {\n    (source: string, subString: string): boolean;\n}\n\n일단 정의되면 다른 인터페이스처럼 이 함수 타입의 인터페이스를 사용할 수 있습니다.여기서는 함수 타입의 변수를 생성하고 동일한 타입의 함수 값을 할당하는 방법을 보여줍니다.\nlet mySearch: SearchFunc;\nmySearch = function(source: string, subString: string) {\n    let result = source.search(subString);\n    return result > -1;\n}\n\n함수 타입의 타입을 검사할 때 매개 변수의 이름이 일치할 필요는 없습니다.예를 들어 다음과 같은 예를 작성할 수 있습니다:\nlet mySearch: SearchFunc;\nmySearch = function(src: string, sub: string): boolean {\n    let result = src.search(sub);\n    return result > -1;\n}\n\n함수 매개 변수는 하나씩 검사되며 각 해당 파라미터 위치의 타입을 서로 비교하며 검사합니다.타입을 지정하지 않으려는 경우 함수 값이 SearchFunc 타입의 변수에 직접 지정되므로 TypeScript의 컨텍스트 타입(contextual typing)에 따라 인수 타입을 추론할 수 있습니다.또한 여기서 함수 표현식의 반환 타입은 반환되는 값에 의해서도 암시적으로 나타납니다(여기서는 true와 false)함수 표현식이 숫자나 문자열을 반환하는 경우 타입-체커가 반환 타입이 SearchFunc 인터페이스에 설명된 반환 타입과 일치하지 않는다는 경고했을 것입니다\nlet mySearch: SearchFunc;\nmySearch = function(src, sub) {\n    let result = src.search(sub);\n    return result > -1;\n}\n\n인덱싱 가능 타입(Indexable Types)\n함수 타입을 설명하기 위해 인터페이스를 사용하는 방법과 마찬가지로 a[10] 또는 ageMap[\"daniel\"]처럼 \"인덱스\"를 생성할 수 있는 타입을 만들 수도 있습니다.인덱싱 가능 타입에는 객체로 인덱싱 하는 데 사용할 수 있는 타입과 인덱싱 할 때 해당 반환 타입을 설명하는 인덱스 시그니처(index signature) 이 있습니다.예를 들어 보겠습니다.\ninterface StringArray {\n    [index: number]: string;\n}\n\nlet myArray: StringArray;\nmyArray = [\"Bob\", \"Fred\"];\n\nlet myStr: string = myArray[0];\n\n위에서 우리는 인덱스 시그니처(index signature)을 가진 String Array 인터페이스를 가지고 있습니다.이 인덱스 시그니처은 StringArray이 number로 인덱싱 될 때 string을 반환한다는 것을 나타냅니다.\n지원되는 인덱스 시그니처에는 문자열과 숫자의 두 가지 타입이 있습니다.두 가지 타입의 인덱서(indexer)를 모두 지원할 수 있지만 숫자(numeric) 인덱서에서 반환되는 타입은 문자열(string) 인덱서에서 반환된 타입의 하위 타입이어야 합니다.왜냐하면 number로 인덱싱을 생성하는 시점에 JavaScript가 객체로 인덱싱하기 전에 string으로 변환하기 때문입니다.즉 100 (number)로 인덱싱하는 것은 \"100\" (string)으로 인덱싱하는 것과 동일하므로 두 가지 모두 일관성이 있어야 합니다.\nclass Animal {\n    name: string;\n}\nclass Dog extends Animal {\n    breed: string;\n}\n\n// 오류: numeric과 string으로 인덱싱하면 완전히 다른 타입의 Animal을 얻을 수 있습니다!\ninterface NotOkay {\n    [x: number]: Animal;\n    [x: string]: Dog;\n}\n\n문자열 인덱스 시그니처(index signatures)이 \"사전(dictionary)\" 패턴을 만드는 강력한 방법이지만 모든 프로퍼티가 반환 타입과 일치하도록 강요합니다.문자열 인덱스의 obj.property가 obj[\"property\"]으로도 사용할 수 있다고 선언하기 때문입니다.다음 예에서는 name의 타입이 문자열 인덱스의 타입과 일치하지 않으며 타입-체커에서 오류를 표시합니다\ninterface NumberDictionary {\n    [index: string]: number;\n    length: number;    // 좋아요, length는 number입니다.\n    name: string;      // 오류, 'name'의 타입이 인덱서의 하위 타입이 아닙니다.\n}\n\n마지막으로 인덱스에 할당되지 않도록 인덱스 시그니처(index signatures)을 읽기 전용(readonly)으로 만들 수 있습니다:\ninterface ReadonlyStringArray {\n    readonly [index: number]: string;\n}\nlet myArray: ReadonlyStringArray = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\"];\nmyArray[2] = \"Mallory\"; // 오류!\n\n인덱스 시그니처이 읽기 전용이므로 myArray[2]를 설정할 수 없습니다.\n클래스 타입 (Class Types)\n인터페이스 구현 (Implementing an interface)\nC# 및 Java와 같은 언어로 인터페이스를 사용하는 가장 일반적인 방법 중 하나로 클래스가 특정 계약을 충족하도록 명시적인 강제가 TypeScript에서도 가능하다는 것입니다.\ninterface ClockInterface {\n    currentTime: Date;\n}\n\nclass Clock implements ClockInterface {\n    currentTime: Date;\n    constructor(h: number, m: number) { }\n}\n\n또한 아래의 예제에서 setTime과 마찬가지로 클래스에 구현된 인터페이스의 메서드를 만들 수도 있습니다.\ninterface ClockInterface {\n    currentTime: Date;\n    setTime(d: Date);\n}\n\nclass Clock implements ClockInterface {\n    currentTime: Date;\n    setTime(d: Date) {\n        this.currentTime = d;\n    }\n    constructor(h: number, m: number) { }\n}\n\n인터페이스는 public 측면과 private 측면이 아닌 public 측면의 class를 만듭니다.클래스를 사용하여 클래스 인스턴스의 private 측에 특정 타입이 있는지 검사하는 것은 금지되어 있습니다.\n클래스의 스태틱과 인스턴스의 차이점(Difference between the static and instance sides of classes)\n클래스와 인터페이스로 작업할 때 클래스에 두 가지 타입이 있음을 명심하세요: 스태틱 측면의 타입과 인스턴스 측면의 타입construct signature으로 인터페이스를 만들고 이 인터페이스를 구현하는 클래스를 생성하려고 하면 오류가 발생할 수 있습니다:\ninterface ClockConstructor {\n    new (hour: number, minute: number);\n}\n\nclass Clock implements ClockConstructor {\n    currentTime: Date;\n    constructor(h: number, m: number) { }\n}\n\n왜냐하면 클래스가 인터페이스를 구현할 때 클래스의 인스턴스 측면만 검사되기 때문입니다.생성자는 정적인 측면이기 때문에 이 검사에 포함되지 않습니다.\n대신 클래스의 정적인 측면에서 직접 작업해야 합니다.이 예제에서는 생성자를 위한 ClockConstructor와 인스턴스 메서드를 위한 ClockInterface라는 두 개의 인터페이스를 정의합니다.편의상 전달된 타입의 인스턴스를 생성하는 createClock 생성자 함수를 정의합니다.\ninterface ClockConstructor {\n    new (hour: number, minute: number): ClockInterface;\n}\ninterface ClockInterface {\n    tick();\n}\n\nfunction createClock(ctor: ClockConstructor, hour: number, minute: number): ClockInterface {\n    return new ctor(hour, minute);\n}\n\nclass DigitalClock implements ClockInterface {\n    constructor(h: number, m: number) { }\n    tick() {\n        console.log(\"beep beep\");\n    }\n}\nclass AnalogClock implements ClockInterface {\n    constructor(h: number, m: number) { }\n    tick() {\n        console.log(\"tick tock\");\n    }\n}\n\nlet digital = createClock(DigitalClock, 12, 17);\nlet analog = createClock(AnalogClock, 7, 32);\n\ncreateClock의 첫 번째 매개 변수는 createClock(AnalogClock, 7, 32)에 ClockConstructor 타입이므로 AnalogClock이 올바른 생성자 시그니처(constructor signature)을 가지고 있는지 확인합니다.\n인터페이스 확장 (Extending Interfaces)\n클래스처럼 인터페이스도 서로를 확장할 수 있습니다.이렇게 하면 한 인터페이스의 멤버를 다른 인터페이스로 복사할 수 있으므로 인터페이스를 재사용 가능한 컴포넌트로 분리하는 방법을 더 유연하게 할 수 있습니다.\ninterface Shape {\n    color: string;\n}\n\ninterface Square extends Shape {\n    sideLength: number;\n}\n\nlet square = {};\nsquare.color = \"blue\";\nsquare.sideLength = 10;\n\n여러 인터페이스를 확장하여 모든 인터페이스를 결합하여 만들 수 있습니다.\ninterface Shape {\n    color: string;\n}\n\ninterface PenStroke {\n    penWidth: number;\n}\n\ninterface Square extends Shape, PenStroke {\n    sideLength: number;\n}\n\nlet square = {};\nsquare.color = \"blue\";\nsquare.sideLength = 10;\nsquare.penWidth = 5.0;\n\n하이브리드 타입 (Hybrid Types)\n이전에 언급했듯이 인터페이스는 실제 JavaScript에서 제공되는 풍부한 타입을 만들 수 있습니다.JavaScript의 동적이고 유연한 특성으로 인해 위에 설명된 몇 가지 타입의 조합으로 작동하는 객체를 종종 볼 수 있습니다.\n이러한 예로는 다음과 같이 추가 프로퍼티로 함수와 객체 역할을 모두 하는 객체가 있습니다:\ninterface Counter {\n    (start: number): string;\n    interval: number;\n    reset(): void;\n}\n\nfunction getCounter(): Counter {\n    let counter = function (start: number) { };\n    counter.interval = 123;\n    counter.reset = function () { };\n    return counter;\n}\n\nlet c = getCounter();\nc(10);\nc.reset();\nc.interval = 5.0;\n\n써드-파티 JavaScript와 상호 작용할 때 타입의 형태를 완전히 형성하려면 위와 같은 패턴을 사용해야 할 수 있습니다.\n인터페이스 확장 클래스 (Interfaces Extending Classes)\n인터페이스 타입이 클래스 타입을 확장하면 해당 클래스의 멤버들을 상속하지만 구현을 상속하지는 않습니다.이는 마치 인터페이스가 구현을 제공하지 않고 클래스의 모든 멤버를 선언한 것과 같습니다.인터페이스는 기본 클래스의 private 및 protected 멤버조차도 상속합니다.즉 private 또는 protected 멤버가 있는 클래스를 확장하는 인터페이스를 생성하면 해당 인터페이스 타입은 해당 클래스 또는 해당 클래스의 서브 클래스에서만 구현할 수 있습니다.\n이는 상속 계층이 크지만 특정 프로퍼티를 가진 서브 클래스에서만 코드가 작동하도록 지정하려는 경우에 유용합니다.서브 클래스는 기본 클래스에서 상속받는 것 외에는 관련이 없습니다.\n예를 들면:\nclass Control {\n    private state: any;\n}\n\ninterface SelectableControl extends Control {\n    select(): void;\n}\n\nclass Button extends Control implements SelectableControl {\n    select() { }\n}\n\nclass TextBox extends Control {\n    select() { }\n}\n\n// 오류: 'Image' 타입의 'state' 프로퍼티가 없습니다.\nclass Image implements SelectableControl {\n    select() { }\n}\n\nclass Location {\n\n}\n\n위의 예제에서 SelectableControl에는 Private state 프로퍼티를 포함한 Control의 모든 멤버가 포함되어 있습니다.state는 private 멤버이기 때문에 Control의 자식만 SelectableControl을 구현할 수 있습니다.왜냐하면 Control의 자식들만이 같은 선언에서 시작된 state private 멤버를 가지기 때문입니다.이것은 private 멤버들이 호환 가능해야 합니다.\nControl 클래스 내에서 SelectableControl의 인스턴스를 통해 state private 멤버에 접근할 수 있습니다.실제로 SelectableControl은 알려진 대로 select 메서드를 가진 Control과 같은 역할을 합니다.Button과 TextBox 클래스는 SelectableControl의 하위 타입입니다(왜냐하면 둘 다 Control을 상속받으며 select 메서드를 가지기 때문입니다).그러나 Image 클래스와 Location 클래스는 그렇지 않습니다.\n"},"pages/Classes.html":{"url":"pages/Classes.html","title":"클래스","keywords":"","body":"소개 (Introduction)\n전통적인 JavaScript는 재사용 가능한 컴포넌트를 만들기 위해 함수와 프로토 타입 기반의 상속을 사용하지만 클래스가 함수를 상속하고 객체가 이러한 클래스에서 구축되는 객체 지향 접근 방식에 익숙하지 않은 개발자들에게는 다소 어색함을 느낄 수 있습니다.ECMAScript6로도 알려진 ECMAScript 2015년을 시작으로 JavaScript 개발자는 이 객체 지향 클래스 기반 접근 방식을 사용하여 응용 프로그램을 구축 할 수 있습니다.TypeScript에서는 개발자가 이 기술을 사용하고 다음 JavaScript 버전을 기다리지 않고도 모든 메이저 브라우저와 플랫폼에서 작동하는 JavaScript로 컴파일 할 수 있습니다.\n클래스 (Classes)\n간단한 클래스 기반 예제를 살펴보겠습니다:\nclass Greeter {\n    greeting: string;\n    constructor(message: string) {\n        this.greeting = message;\n    }\n    greet() {\n        return \"Hello, \" + this.greeting;\n    }\n}\n\nlet greeter = new Greeter(\"world\");\n\n이전에 C# 또는 Java를 사용한 적이 있는 경우 구문이 익숙하게 보여야 합니다.새로운 클래스인 Greeter을 선언합니다.\n이 클래스에는 3개의 멤버가 있습니다: greeting 프로퍼티와 생성자 그리고 greet 메서드가 있습니다.\n클래스의 멤버 중 하나를 참조할 때 클래스에서 this를 앞에 접두어로 붙입니다.\n이것은 멤버에 접근하는 것을 뜻합니다.\n마지막 줄에서는 new를 사용하여 Greeter 클래스의 인스턴스를 만듭니다.이것은 이전에 정의한 생성자를 호출하여 Greeter 형태의 새 객체를 만들고 생성자를 실행하여 이를 초기화합니다.\n상속 (Inheritance)\nTypeScript에서는 일반적인 객체 지향 패턴을 사용할 수 있습니다.클래스 기반 프로그래밍에서 가장 기본적인 패턴 중 하나는 상속을 사용하여 기존 클래스를 확장하여 새로운 클래스를 생성할 수 있다는 것입니다.\n예제를 살펴보겠습니다:\nclass Animal {\n    move(distanceInMeters: number = 0) {\n        console.log(`Animal moved ${distanceInMeters}m.`);\n    }\n}\n\nclass Dog extends Animal {\n    bark() {\n        console.log('Woof! Woof!');\n    }\n}\n\nconst dog = new Dog();\ndog.bark();\ndog.move(10);\ndog.bark();\n\n이 예제는 가장 기본적인 상속 기능을 보여줍니다: 클래스는 기본 클래스에서 속성과 메서드를 상속받습니다.여기서 Dog는 extends 키워드를 사용하여 Animal 기본 클래스에서 유래된 파생 클래스입니다.파생 클래스는 종종 하위 클래스(subclasses) 라고 하며 기본 클래스는 슈퍼 클래스(superclasses) 라고도 합니다.\nDog는 Animal로부터 기능을 확장시키기 때문에 bark()와 move() 둘 다 할 수 있는 Dog의 인스턴스를 만들 수 있었습니다.\n이제 좀 더 복잡한 예제를 살펴보겠습니다.\nclass Animal {\n    name: string;\n    constructor(theName: string) { this.name = theName; }\n    move(distanceInMeters: number = 0) {\n        console.log(`${this.name} moved ${distanceInMeters}m.`);\n    }\n}\n\nclass Snake extends Animal {\n    constructor(name: string) { super(name); }\n    move(distanceInMeters = 5) {\n        console.log(\"Slithering...\");\n        super.move(distanceInMeters);\n    }\n}\n\nclass Horse extends Animal {\n    constructor(name: string) { super(name); }\n    move(distanceInMeters = 45) {\n        console.log(\"Galloping...\");\n        super.move(distanceInMeters);\n    }\n}\n\nlet sam = new Snake(\"Sammy the Python\");\nlet tom: Animal = new Horse(\"Tommy the Palomino\");\n\nsam.move();\ntom.move(34);\n\n이 예제는 앞서 언급하지 않은 몇 가지 다른 기능을 다룹니다.이번에도 Animal의 새로운 하위 클래스인 Horse과 Snake을 만드는 extends 키워드가 등장합니다.\n이전 예제와의 한 가지 다른 점은 생성자 함수를 포함하는 각 파생 클래스가 기본 클래스의 생성자를 실행할 super()를 호출해야한다는 것입니다.게다가 생성자 내에서 this에 있는 프로퍼티에 접근하기 전에 항상 super()를 호출해야 합니다.이것은 TypeScript가 적용할 중요한 규칙입니다.\n또한 이 예제에서는 기본 클래스의 메서드를 하위 클래스에 특화된 메서드를 오버라이드 하는 방법도 보여 줍니다.\n여기에서 Snake와 Horse는 Animal의 move를 오버라이드하고 각 클래스에 고유한 기능을 부여하는 move 메서드를 만듭니다.\ntom은 Animal로 선언되었지만 Horse의 값을 가지므로 tom.move(34)를 호출하면 Horse의 오버라이딩 메서드가 호출됩니다:\nSlithering...\nSammy the Python moved 5m.\nGalloping...\nTommy the Palomino moved 34m.\n\nPublic, private, 그리고 protected 지정자 (Public, private, and protected modifiers)\n기본적인 Public (Public by default)\n예를 들어 프로그램을 통해 선언된 멤버들에 자유롭게 접근할 수 있었습니다.\n다른 언어의 클래스에 익숙하다면 위의 예제에서 public을 사용하지 않아도 된다는 사실을 알았을 것입니다.예를 들어 C#의 경우 각 멤버를 public으로 표시하도록 명시해야합니다.\nTypeScript에서는 기본적으로 각 멤버가 public입니다.\n그럼에도 불구하고 public를 멤버를 명시적으로 표시할 수 있습니다.이전 섹션의 Animal 클래스를 다음과 같이 작성할 수 있었습니다:\nclass Animal {\n    public name: string;\n    public constructor(theName: string) { this.name = theName; }\n    public move(distanceInMeters: number) {\n        console.log(`${this.name} moved ${distanceInMeters}m.`);\n    }\n}\n\nprivate 이해하기 (Understanding private)\n멤버가 private으로 표시되면 그 멤버를 포함하는 클래스의 외부에서는 접근할 수 없습니다. 예 :\nclass Animal {\n    private name: string;\n    constructor(theName: string) { this.name = theName; }\n}\n\nnew Animal(\"Cat\").name; // 오류: 'name'은 private이다;\n\nTypeScript는 구조적인 타입의 시스템입니다.두 개의 다른 타입을 비교할 때 그것들이 어디서 왔는지에 관계없이 모든 멤버의 타입이 호환 가능하다면 그 타입 자체가 호환성(compatible)이 있다고 말합니다.\n그러나 private 및 protected멤버가 있는 타입을 비교할 때 이러한 타입들은 다르게 처리합니다.\n호환성(compatible)이 있는 것으로 판단되는 두 가지 타입 중 private멤버가 있는 경우 다른 멤버는 동일한 선언에서 유래된 private멤버가 있어야 합니다.이것은 protected멤버에도 적용됩니다.\n실제로 이러한 기능이 어떻게 작동하는지를 더 잘 알아보기 위한 예를 살펴보겠습니다:\nclass Animal {\n    private name: string;\n    constructor(theName: string) { this.name = theName; }\n}\n\nclass Rhino extends Animal {\n    constructor() { super(\"Rhino\"); }\n}\n\nclass Employee {\n    private name: string;\n    constructor(theName: string) { this.name = theName; }\n}\n\nlet animal = new Animal(\"Goat\");\nlet rhino = new Rhino();\nlet employee = new Employee(\"Bob\");\n\nanimal = rhino;\nanimal = employee; // 오류: 'Animal'과 'Employee'는 호환되지 않습니다.\n\n이 예제에서는 Animal과 Rhino가 있습니다. Rhino는 Animal의 하위 클래스입니다.또한 구체적으로 Animal과 같아 보이는 Employee라는 새로운 클래스를 가지고 있습니다.이러한 클래스들의 인스턴스들을 만들고 서로를 할당하여 어떠한 일이 발생하는지 봅시다.\nAnimal과 Rhino는 Animal의 private name: string 선언으로부터 private의 형태를 공유하기 때문에 호환됩니다.그러나 Employee의 경우는 그렇지 않습니다.\nEmployee를 Animal에 할당하려고 할 때 이 타입들은 호환되지 않는다는 오류가 발생합니다.Employee도 name이라는 private 멤버가 있지만 Animal에서 선언한 것이 아닙니다.\nprotected 이해하기 (Understanding protected)\nprotected 지정자는 private 지정자와 매우 유사하게 동작합니다.단 protected 멤버도 선언된 파생 클래스의 인스턴스에서 접근할 수 있습니다.  \n예를 들어\nclass Person {\n    protected name: string;\n    constructor(name: string) { this.name = name; }\n}\n\nclass Employee extends Person {\n    private department: string;\n\n    constructor(name: string, department: string) {\n        super(name);\n        this.department = department;\n    }\n\n    public getElevatorPitch() {\n        return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I work in ${this.department}.`;\n    }\n}\n\nlet howard = new Employee(\"Howard\", \"Sales\");\nconsole.log(howard.getElevatorPitch());\nconsole.log(howard.name); // 오류\n\nPerson의 외부에서 name을 사용할 수는 없지만 Employee는 Person으로부터 파생되기 때문에 Employee의 인스턴스 메서드 내에서 여전히 사용할 수 있습니다.\n생성자 또한 protected로 표시될 수도 있습니다.즉 클래스를 포함하는 클래스 외부에서 클래스를 인스턴스화할 수는 없지만 확장될 수는 있습니다.\n예를 들어\nclass Person {\n    protected name: string;\n    protected constructor(theName: string) { this.name = theName; }\n}\n\n// Employee는 Person을 확장할 수 있습니다\nclass Employee extends Person {\n    private department: string;\n\n    constructor(name: string, department: string) {\n        super(name);\n        this.department = department;\n    }\n\n    public getElevatorPitch() {\n        return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I work in ${this.department}.`;\n    }\n}\n\nlet howard = new Employee(\"Howard\", \"Sales\");\nlet john = new Person(\"John\"); // 오류: 'Person'의 생성자는 protected입니다.\n\nReadonly 지정자 (Readonly modifier)\nreadonly 키워드를 사용하여 프로퍼티들을 읽기 전용으로 만들 수 있습니다.\n읽기 전용 프로퍼티들은 선언 또는 생성자에서 초기화해야합니다.\nclass Octopus {\n    readonly name: string;\n    readonly numberOfLegs: number = 8;\n    constructor (theName: string) {\n        this.name = theName;\n    }\n}\nlet dad = new Octopus(\"Man with the 8 strong legs\");\ndad.name = \"Man with the 3-piece suit\"; // 오류! name은 readonly입니다.\n\n매개변수 프로퍼티 (Parameter properties)\n마지막 예제의 Octopus 클래스에서 readonly 멤버 name과 생성자 매개변수 theName을 선언했습니다.그 다음 바로 name을 theName으로 설정했습니다.\n이것은 매우 일반적인 방법입니다.매개변수 프로퍼티(Parameter properties) 를 사용하면 한 곳에서 멤버를 생성하고 초기화할 수 있습니다.다음은 매개 변수 프로퍼티를 사용하여 이전에 Octopus 클래스를 추가적으로 수정합니다:\nclass Octopus {\n    readonly numberOfLegs: number = 8;\n    constructor(readonly name: string) {\n    }\n}\n\ntheName을 어떻게 삭제했는지 확인하고 생성자에서 readonly name : string 매개 변수를 사용해 멤버 name을 생성하고 초기화할 수 있습니다.\n선언과 할당을 하나의 장소로 통합했습니다.\n매개변수 프로퍼티는 접근 지정자(accessibility modifier) 또는 readonly 또는 둘 모두로 생성자 매개변수를 접두어로 붙여 선언합니다.매개 변수 프로퍼티에 private을 사용하면 private 멤버가 선언되고 초기화됩니다.마찬가지로 public와 protected 그리고 readonly도 마찬가지입니다.\n접근자 (Accessors)\nTypeScript는 객체의 멤버에 대한 접근을 인터셉트하는 방법으로 getters/setters를 지원합니다.이것을 통해 각 객체에서 멤버에 접근하는 방법을 세부적으로 제어할 수 있습니다.\n간단한 클래스에 get과 set을 사용하도록 변환해봅시다.\n먼저 getter와 setter가 없는 예제부터 시작합시다.\nclass Employee {\n    fullName: string;\n}\n\nlet employee = new Employee();\nemployee.fullName = \"Bob Smith\";\nif (employee.fullName) {\n    console.log(employee.fullName);\n}\n\n사람들이 임의로 fullName을 직접 설정하는 것은 매우 편리하지만 기분 내키는 대로 이름을 바꿀 수 있다면 문제를 일으킬 수 있습니다\n이 버전에서는 employee를 수정할 수 있도록 하기 전에 사용자가 passcode를 사용할 수 있는지 확인합니다.이를 위해 passcode를 확인할 fullName에 대한 직접적인 권한을 set으로 교체합니다.앞의 예제가 계속해서 원활하게 작동하도록 하기 위해 그에 상응하는 get을 추가합니다.\nlet passcode = \"secret passcode\";\n\nclass Employee {\n    private _fullName: string;\n\n    get fullName(): string {\n        return this._fullName;\n    }\n\n    set fullName(newName: string) {\n        if (passcode && passcode == \"secret passcode\") {\n            this._fullName = newName;\n        }\n        else {\n            console.log(\"오류 : employee의 무단 업데이트!\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nlet employee = new Employee();\nemployee.fullName = \"Bob Smith\";\nif (employee.fullName) {\n    console.log(employee.fullName);\n}\n\n접근자가 passcode를 확인하고 있다는 것을 입증하기 위해 passcode를 수정하고 passcode가 일치하지 않을 경우 employee에게 업데이트 권한이 없다는 경고 메시지를 받을 수 있습니다.\n접근자에 대해 알아야 할 몇 가지 주의사항:\n첫째, 접근자를 사용하려면 ECMAScript5 이상을 출력하도록 컴파일러를 설정해야 합니다.\nECMAScript3 다운그레이드는 지원되지 않습니다.\n둘째, get과 set을 가진 접근자는 자동적으로 readonly로 추론됩니다.이것은 코드에서 .d.ts 파일을 생성할 때 유용합니다. 왜냐하면 프로퍼티를 변경할 수 없다는 것을 알 수 있기 때문입니다.\n정적 프로퍼티 (Static Properties)\n지금까지는 인스턴스의 클래스 멤버들에 대해서만 이야기했습니다.인스턴스는 인스턴스화될 때 객체에서 나타납니다.또한 인스턴스가 아닌 클래스 자체에 볼 수 있는 스태틱 멤버도 생성할 수 있습니다.\n이 예제에서는 모든 grid의 일반적인 값이기 때문에 origin에 스태틱을 사용합니다.각 인스턴스는 클래스의 이름을 미리 정의하여 이 값에 접근합니다.인스턴스의 접근자 앞에 this. 를 추가하는 것과 비슷하게 스태틱 접근자 앞에 Grid를 추가합니다.\nclass Grid {\n    static origin = {x: 0, y: 0};\n    calculateDistanceFromOrigin(point: {x: number; y: number;}) {\n        let xDist = (point.x - Grid.origin.x);\n        let yDist = (point.y - Grid.origin.y);\n        return Math.sqrt(xDist * xDist + yDist * yDist) / this.scale;\n    }\n    constructor (public scale: number) { }\n}\n\nlet grid1 = new Grid(1.0);  // 1x scale\nlet grid2 = new Grid(5.0);  // 5x scale\n\nconsole.log(grid1.calculateDistanceFromOrigin({x: 10, y: 10}));\nconsole.log(grid2.calculateDistanceFromOrigin({x: 10, y: 10}));\n\n추상 클래스 (Abstract Classes)\n추상 클래스는 다른 클래스가 파생될 수 있는 기본 클래스입니다.추상 클래스는 직접적으로 인스턴스화할 수 없습니다.인터페이스와 달리 추상 클래스는 클래스의 멤버에 대한 구현 세부 정보를 포함할 수 있습니다.abstract 키워드는 추상 클래스뿐만 아니라 추상 클래스 내의 추상 메서드를 정의하는 데 사용됩니다.\nabstract class Animal {\n    abstract makeSound(): void;\n    move(): void {\n        console.log(\"roaming the earth...\");\n    }\n}\n\nabstract으로 표시된 추상 클래스 내의 메서드는 구현을 포함하지 않으므로 파생된 클래스에서 구현해야 합니다.추상 메서드는 인터페이스 메서드와 유사한 구문을 사용합니다.둘 다 메서드 본문을 포함하지 않고 메소드를 정의합니다.그러나 추상 메서드는 abstract 키워드를 포함해야 하며 선택적으로 접근 지정자를 포함할 수 있습니다.\nabstract class Department {\n\n    constructor(public name: string) {\n    }\n\n    printName(): void {\n        console.log(\"Department name: \" + this.name);\n    }\n\n    abstract printMeeting(): void; // 파생된 클래스에서 구현해야 합니다.\n}\n\nclass AccountingDepartment extends Department {\n\n    constructor() {\n        super(\"Accounting and Auditing\"); // 파생된 클래스의 생성자는 super()를 호출해야합니다.\n    }\n\n    printMeeting(): void {\n        console.log(\"The Accounting Department meets each Monday at 10am.\");\n    }\n\n    generateReports(): void {\n        console.log(\"Generating accounting reports...\");\n    }\n}\n\nlet department: Department; // 좋아요: abstract 타입에 대한 참조를 만듭니다.\ndepartment = new Department(); // 오류: 추상 클래스의 인스턴스를 생성할 수 없습니다.\ndepartment = new AccountingDepartment(); // 좋아요: 추상적이지 않은 하위 클래스를 생성하고 할당합니다.\ndepartment.printName();\ndepartment.printMeeting();\ndepartment.generateReports(); // 오류: abstract 타입으로 선언된 메서드가 존재하지 않습니다.\n\n고급 기법 (Advanced Techniques)\n생성자 함수 (Constructor functions)\nTypeScript에서 클래스를 선언하면 실제로 여러 선언이 동시에 생성됩니다.\n첫 번째 클래스의 인스턴스 타입입니다.\nclass Greeter {\n    greeting: string;\n    constructor(message: string) {\n        this.greeting = message;\n    }\n    greet() {\n        return \"Hello, \" + this.greeting;\n    }\n}\n\nlet greeter: Greeter;\ngreeter = new Greeter(\"world\");\nconsole.log(greeter.greet());\n\n여기서 let greeter: Greeter라고 할 때 Greeter 클래스의 인스턴스 타입으로 Greeter를 사용합니다.이것는 다른 객체 지향 언어를 사용하는 개발자에게는 거의 두 번째 특성입니다.\n또한 생성자 함수라고 부르는 또 다른 값을 생성하고 있습니다.\n이것은 클래스의 인스턴스를 new 할 때 호출되는 함수입니다.\n실제로 이 과정이 어떻게 진행되고 있는지 확인하기 위해 위의 예제에서 생성된 JavaScript를 살펴보겠습니다:\nlet Greeter = (function () {\n    function Greeter(message) {\n        this.greeting = message;\n    }\n    Greeter.prototype.greet = function () {\n        return \"Hello, \" + this.greeting;\n    };\n    return Greeter;\n})();\n\nlet greeter;\ngreeter = new Greeter(\"world\");\nconsole.log(greeter.greet());\n\n여기서 let Greeter는 생성자 함수를 할 받게 될 것입니다.new를 호출하고 이 함수를 실행하면 클래스의 인스턴스를 얻습니다.생성자 함수에는 클래스의 모든 스태틱 멤버 또한 포함됩니다.각각의 클래스를 생각하는 또 다른 방법은 인스턴스 측면과 스태틱 측면이 있다는 것입니다.\n이 차이를 보여 주기 위해 예제를 약간 수정해 보겠습니다:\nclass Greeter {\n    static standardGreeting = \"Hello, there\";\n    greeting: string;\n    greet() {\n        if (this.greeting) {\n            return \"Hello, \" + this.greeting;\n        }\n        else {\n            return Greeter.standardGreeting;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nlet greeter1: Greeter;\ngreeter1 = new Greeter();\nconsole.log(greeter1.greet());\n\nlet greeterMaker: typeof Greeter = Greeter;\ngreeterMaker.standardGreeting = \"Hey there!\";\n\nlet greeter2: Greeter = new greeterMaker();\nconsole.log(greeter2.greet());\n\n이 예제에서 greeter1은 이전과 비슷하게 작동합니다.Greeter 클래스를 인스턴스화하고 이 객체를 사용합니다.이것은 전에 본 적이 있는 것입니다.\n그런 다음 그 클래스를 직접 사용합니다.여기서 greeterMaker라는 새로운 변수를 만듭니다.이 변수는 클래스 자체를 유지하거나 생성자 함수라고 하는 또 다른 방법으로 설명합니다.  \n여기서는 typeof Greeter를 사용합니다.즉 \"인스턴스 타입이 아닌 \"Greeter 클래스 자체의 타입을 제공합니다\".또는 더 정확하게 생성자 함수의 타입인 \"Greeter라는 symbol 타입을 제공합니다\".이 타입에는 Greeter 클래스의 인스턴스를 생성하는 생성자와 함께 Greeter의 모든 스태틱 멤버가 포함됩니다.greeterMaker에 new를 사용하는 것을 보여 주며 Greeter의 새로운 인스턴스를 생성하고 이전과 같이 호출합니다.\n클래스를 인터페이스로 사용하기 (Using a class as an interface)\n앞서 언급한 것처럼 클래스 선언은 두 가지를 생성합니다: 클래스의 인스턴스를 나타내는 타입과 생성자 함수클래스는 타입을 작성하기 때문에 인터페이스를 사용할 수 있는 동일한 위치에서 타입을 사용할 수 있습니다.\nclass Point {\n    x: number;\n    y: number;\n}\n\ninterface Point3d extends Point {\n    z: number;\n}\n\nlet point3d: Point3d = {x: 1, y: 2, z: 3};\n\n"},"pages/Functions.html":{"url":"pages/Functions.html","title":"함수","keywords":"","body":"소개 (Introduction)\n함수는 JavaScript의 모든 애플리케이션을 구성하는 기본 요소입니다.클래스는 추상화 계층, 클래스, 정보 은닉 및 모듈을 구축하는 방법입니다.TypeScript에서는 클래스와 네임 스페이스 그리고 모듈이 있지만 함수는 그럼에도 불구하고 작업 방법을 설명하는 데 중요한 역할을 합니다.또한 TypeScript는 표준 JavaScript 기능에 몇가지 새로운 기능을 추가하여 작업을 더 쉽게 해 줍니다.\n함수 (Functions)\nJavaScript와 마찬가지로 TypeScript 함수는 기명 함수 또는 익명 함수로 만들 수 있습니다.이를 통해 API의 함수 목록을 작성하든 다른 함수에 전달할 일회성 함수이든 애플리케이션에 가장 적합한 접근 방법을 선택할 수 있습니다.\n이 두가지 접근 방식이 JavaScript에서 어떻게 보이는지 빠르게 요약하면:\n// 기명 함수\nfunction add(x, y) {\n    return x + y;\n}\n\n// 익명 함수\nlet myAdd = function(x, y) { return x + y; };\n\nJavaScript에서와 마찬가지로 함수는 함수 본문 외부의 변수를 참조할 수 있습니다.그렇게 할 때 이러한 변수들을 capture라고 말합니다.이 기법의 사용 방법과 사용할 때의 절충 사항을 이해하는 것은 이번 장의 범위를 벗어나지만캡처의 메커니즘이 JavaScript와 TypeScript에 얼마나 중요한 부분인지 확실히 이해해야 합니다.\nlet z = 100;\n\nfunction addToZ(x, y) {\n    return x + y + z;\n}\n\n함수의 타입 (Function Types)\n함수 작성하기 (Typing the function)\n앞에서 살펴본 간단한 예제에 타입을 추가해보겠습니다.\nfunction add(x: number, y: number): number {\n    return x + y;\n}\n\nlet myAdd = function(x: number, y: number): number { return x + y; };\n\n각 매개변수에 타입을 추가 한 다음 함수 자체에 타입을 추가하여 반환 타입을 추가할 수 있습니다.TypeScript는 리턴문를 보고 반환 타입을 파악할 수 있기 때문에 대부분 선택적으로 반환 타입을 생략할 수 있습니다.\n함수 타입 작성하기 (Writing the function type)\n이제 함수를 작성했으므로 함수 타입의 각 부분을 살펴보면서 함수의 전체 타입을 작성해보겠습니다.\nlet myAdd: (x: number, y: number) => number =\n    function(x: number, y: number): number { return x + y; };\n\n함수의 타입은 두개의 파트로 나뉩니다: 인수의 타입과 반환 타입.전체 함수 타입을 작성할 때 두 파트가 모두 필요합니다.매개변수 타입과 같이 매개변수 목록을 기록하여 각 매개변수에 이름과 타입을 지정합니다.이 이름은 가독성을 돕기 위한 것입니다.\n위의 코드를 다음과 같이 작성할 수 있습니다:\nlet myAdd: (baseValue: number, increment: number) => number =\n    function(x: number, y: number): number { return x + y; };\n\n매개변수 타입이 정렬되어 있는 한 함수의 타입에 매개변수를 제공하는 이름에 관계 없이 매개변수 타입이 유효한 타입으로 간주됩니다.\n두 번째 파트는 반환 타입입니다.매개변수와 반환 타입 사이에 굵은 화살표(=>)를 사용하여 반환 타입을 명확하게 합니다.앞서 언급한 것처럼 이것은 함수 타입의 필수적인 부분이므로 함수가 값을 반환하지 않는 경우에는 반환 값을 남겨 두지 않고 void를 사용합니다.\n주의사항, 매개변수와 반환 타입만 함수 타입을 구성합니다.캡처된 변수는 타입에 반영되지 않습니다.실제로 캡처된 변수는 함수의 \"숨겨진 상태\"의 일부이며 해당 API를 구성하지 않습니다.\n타입 추론 (Inferring the types)\n예를 들면 TypeScript 컴파일러는 한쪽에는 타입이 있지만 다른 한쪽에 타입이 없는 경우 그 타입을 이해할 수 없다는 것을 알게 됩니다:\n// myAdd는 완벽하게 함수 타입을 가지고 있습니다.\nlet myAdd = function(x: number, y: number): number { return  x + y; };\n\n// 매개변수 'x'와 'y'에는 number 타입이 있습니다.\nlet myAdd: (baseValue: number, increment: number) => number =\n    function(x, y) { return x + y; };\n\n이것을 타입 추론의 한 종류인 \"상황적 타이핑(Contextual Typing)\"이라고 합니다.\n이를 통해 프로그램을 계속 유지하는 데 드는 노력을 줄일 수 있습니다.\n선택적 매개변수와 기본 매개변수 (Optional and Default Parameters)\nTypeScript에서는 모든 매개변수가 함수에 필요하다고 가정합니다.null 또는 undefined가 주어질 수 없다는 것을 의미하는 것이 아니라 함수가 호출될 때 컴파일러가 각 매개변수에 값을 제공했는지 확인한다는 것입니다.또한 컴파일러는 이러한 매개변수들이 함수로 전달되는 유일한 매개변수라고 가정합니다.간단히 말해서 함수에 주어진 인수의 수는 그 함수에서 기대하는 매개변수의 수와 일치해야 합니다.\nfunction buildName(firstName: string, lastName: string) {\n    return firstName + \" \" + lastName;\n}\n\nlet result1 = buildName(\"Bob\");                  // 오류, 너무 적은 매개변수\nlet result2 = buildName(\"Bob\", \"Adams\", \"Sr.\");  // 오류, 너무 많은 매개변수\nlet result3 = buildName(\"Bob\", \"Adams\");         // 아, 딱 맞습니다\n\nJavaScript에서 모든 매개변수는 선택 사항이며 매개변수를 원하는 대로 사용하지 않을 수 있습니다.그렇게 되면 그 매개변수들의 값은 undefined입니다.\nTypeScript에서 선택적인 매개변수를 사용하려면 선택적으로 사용하려는 매개변수의 끝에 ?를 추가하세요.\n예를 들어 위에서 사용한 lastName 매개변수를 선택적으로 사용할 수 있도록 합니다:\nfunction buildName(firstName: string, lastName?: string) {\n    if (lastName)\n        return firstName + \" \" + lastName;\n    else\n        return firstName;\n}\n\nlet result1 = buildName(\"Bob\");                  // 올바르게 작동합니다\nlet result2 = buildName(\"Bob\", \"Adams\", \"Sr.\");  // 오류, 너무 많은 매개변수\nlet result3 = buildName(\"Bob\", \"Adams\");         // 아, 딱 맞습니다\n\n모든 선택적 매개변수는 필수 매개변수를 따라와야 합니다.last name 대신 first name을 선택적 매개변수로 만들고 싶다면 함수의 매개변수 순서를 변경해야 합니다.즉 목록의 first name을 마지막에 넣어야합니다.\nTypeScript에서 사용자가 매개변수를 제공하지 않거나 사용자가 대신 undefined를 전달하더라도 매개변수가에 할당되는 값을 설정할 수 있습니다.이것을 기본 매개변수(default-initialized parameters)라고 합니다.\n앞의 예제를 따라 last name의 기본값을 \"Smith\"로 설정해 보겠습니다.\nfunction buildName(firstName: string, lastName = \"Smith\") {\n    return firstName + \" \" + lastName;\n}\n\nlet result1 = buildName(\"Bob\");                  // 올바르게 작동하며 \"Bob Smith\"를 반환합니다\nlet result2 = buildName(\"Bob\", undefined);       // 여전히 작동하며 \"Bob Smith\"를 반환합니다.\nlet result3 = buildName(\"Bob\", \"Adams\", \"Sr.\");  // 오류, 너무 많은 매개변수\nlet result4 = buildName(\"Bob\", \"Adams\");         // 아, 딱 맞습니다\n\n필수 매개변수의 뒤에 오는 기본 매개변수는 선택적 매개변수로 취급되어 함수를 호출할 때 선택적 매개변수처럼 생략할 수 있습니다.이것은 선택적 매개변수와 후행 기본 매개변수가 해당 타입의 공통점을 공유한다는 것을 의미하므로  \n둘 다\nfunction buildName(firstName: string, lastName?: string) {\n    // ...\n}\n\n그리고\nfunction buildName(firstName: string, lastName = \"Smith\") {\n    // ...\n}\n\n(firstName: string, lastName?: string) => string 동일한 타입을 공유합니다.lastName의 기본 값은 타입에서 사라지고 매개변수가 선택 사항이라는 사실만 남겨졌습니다.\n일반 선택적 매개변수와 달리 기본 매개변수는 필수 매개변수 뒤에 나올 필요가 없습니다.기본 매개변수가 필수 매개변수 앞에 오는 경우 사용자는 명시적으로 undefined를 전달하여 기본 초기화된 값을 가져와야 합니다.\n예를 들어 firstName에 기본 초기화만 있는 마지막 예제를 작성할 수 있습니다:\nfunction buildName(firstName = \"Will\", lastName: string) {\n    return firstName + \" \" + lastName;\n}\n\nlet result1 = buildName(\"Bob\");                  // 오류, 너무 적은 매개변수\nlet result2 = buildName(\"Bob\", \"Adams\", \"Sr.\");  // 오류, 너무 많은 매개변수\nlet result3 = buildName(\"Bob\", \"Adams\");         // 좋아요 \"Bob Adams\"를 반환합니다\nlet result4 = buildName(undefined, \"Adams\");     // 좋아요 \"Will Adams\"를 반환합니다\n\n나머지 매개변수 (Rest Parameters)\n필수 매개변수와 선택적 매개변수 그리고 기본 매개변수 모두 공통점이 하나 있습니다: 한 번에 하나의 매개변수에 대해 이야기합니다.때로는 여러 매개변수를 그룹으로 사용하거나 함수가 마지막으로 가져올 매개변수의 수를 모를 수 있습니다.JavaScript에서는 모든 함수 본문에서 볼 수 있는 arguments를 사용하여 인수를 직접 사용할 수 있습니다.\nTypeScript에서는 다음과 같은 인수를 변수로 함께 모을수 있습니다:\nfunction buildName(firstName: string, ...restOfName: string[]) {\n    return firstName + \" \" + restOfName.join(\" \");\n}\n\nlet employeeName = buildName(\"Joseph\", \"Samuel\", \"Lucas\", \"MacKinzie\");\n\n나머지 매개변수는 무한적인 수의 선택적 매개변수로 처리됩니다.Rest 매개변수에 인수를 전달할 때는 원하는 만큼 사용할 수 있으며 심지어 통과할 수 없습니다.컴파일러는 줄임표 (...) 다음에 전달된 인수들을 배열을 작성하여 함수에서 사용할 수 있습니다.\n줄임표(...)는 나머지 매개변수가 있는 함수의 타입에도 사용됩니다:\nfunction buildName(firstName: string, ...restOfName: string[]) {\n    return firstName + \" \" + restOfName.join(\" \");\n}\n\nlet buildNameFun: (fname: string, ...rest: string[]) => string = buildName;\n\nthis\nJavaScript에서 this를 사용법을 배우는 것은 일종의 통과 의례입니다.TypeScript는 JavaScript의 상위 집합이기 때문에 TypeScript 개발자들도 this을 사용하는 방법과 올바르게 사용되고 있지 않을 때를 찾아내는 방법을 배워야 합니다.JavaScript에서 this가 어떻게 작동하는지 알아야 한다면 Yehuda Katz의 Understanding JavaScript Function Invocation and \"this\"를 먼저 읽어보세요.Yehuda의 글에는 this의 내부 동작을 잘 설명하기 때문에 여기서는 기본적인 내용만 다룰 것입니다.\nthis와 화살표 함수 (this and arrow functions)\nJavaScript에서 this는 함수가 호출될 때 설정되는 변수입니다.매우 강력하고 유연한 기능이지만 함수가 실행되는 상황에 대해 항상 알고 있어야 하는 시간이 듭니다.특히 함수를 반환하거나 함수를 인수로 전달할 때 악명 높을 정도로 혼란스럽습니다.\n예제를 살펴보겠습니다:\nlet deck = {\n    suits: [\"hearts\", \"spades\", \"clubs\", \"diamonds\"],\n    cards: Array(52),\n    createCardPicker: function() {\n        return function() {\n            let pickedCard = Math.floor(Math.random() * 52);\n            let pickedSuit = Math.floor(pickedCard / 13);\n\n            return {suit: this.suits[pickedSuit], card: pickedCard % 13};\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nlet cardPicker = deck.createCardPicker();\nlet pickedCard = cardPicker();\n\nalert(\"card: \" + pickedCard.card + \" of \" + pickedCard.suit);\n\ncreateCardPicker는 자체적으로 함수를 반환하는 함수입니다.예제를 실행하려고 하면 alert 대신 오류가 발생합니다.createCardPicker에 의해 생성된 함수에서 사용되는 this가 deck 객체 대신에 window로 설정되어 있기 때문입니다.왜냐하면 cardPicker()는 자기 자신을 호출하기 때문입니다.이와 같이 최상위 비-메서드 구문 호출은 this에 window를 사용합니다.(주의사항 : 엄격모드(strict mode)에서 this는 window보다는 undefined가 될 것입니다).\n나중에 사용할 함수를 반환하기 전에 함수에 올바른 this가 연결되도록하여 이를 해결할 수 있습니다.\n이렇게하면 나중에 어떻게 사용되든 상관없이 원래의 deck객체를 볼 수 있습니다.이를 위해 함수 표현식을 ECMAScript 6의 화살표 구문으로 변경하여 사용합니다.화살표 함수는 호출된 곳이 아닌 함수가 생성 된 곳에서 this를 캡처합니다:\nlet deck = {\n    suits: [\"hearts\", \"spades\", \"clubs\", \"diamonds\"],\n    cards: Array(52),\n    createCardPicker: function() {\n        // 주의: 아래 줄은 이제 화살표 함수입니다. 여기에서 'this'를 캡처할 수 있습니다.\n        return () => {\n            let pickedCard = Math.floor(Math.random() * 52);\n            let pickedSuit = Math.floor(pickedCard / 13);\n\n            return {suit: this.suits[pickedSuit], card: pickedCard % 13};\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nlet cardPicker = deck.createCardPicker();\nlet pickedCard = cardPicker();\n\nalert(\"card: \" + pickedCard.card + \" of \" + pickedCard.suit);\n\n더 좋은 점은 컴파일러에 --noImplicitThis 신호를 넘겨주면 TypeScript가 실수를 했을 때 경고를 합니다.this.suits[pickedSuit]에서 this는 any 타입입니다.\nthis parameters\n불행히도 this.suits [pickedSuit]의 타입은 여전히any입니다.왜냐하면 this는 객체 리터럴 내부의 함수 표현식에서 왔기 때문입니다.이 문제를 해결하기 위해 명시적으로 this 매개변수를 제공할 수 있습니다.  \nthis 매개변수는 함수의 매개변수 목록에서 처음 나오는 가짜 매개변수입니다:\nfunction f(this: void) {\n    // 이 분리된 함수에서 'this'를 사용할 수 없는지 확인해보세요.\n}\n\n위의 예제에서 Card와 Deck에 몇 가지 인터페이스를 추가하여 타입을 더 명확하고 쉽게 재사용하기 쉽게 만들 수 있도록 하겠습니다\ninterface Card {\n    suit: string;\n    card: number;\n}\ninterface Deck {\n    suits: string[];\n    cards: number[];\n    createCardPicker(this: Deck): () => Card;\n}\nlet deck: Deck = {\n    suits: [\"hearts\", \"spades\", \"clubs\", \"diamonds\"],\n    cards: Array(52),\n    // 주의사항 : 이 함수는 이제 반드시 Deck 타입이어야합니다\n    createCardPicker: function(this: Deck) {\n        return () => {\n            let pickedCard = Math.floor(Math.random() * 52);\n            let pickedSuit = Math.floor(pickedCard / 13);\n\n            return {suit: this.suits[pickedSuit], card: pickedCard % 13};\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nlet cardPicker = deck.createCardPicker();\nlet pickedCard = cardPicker();\n\nalert(\"card: \" + pickedCard.card + \" of \" + pickedCard.suit);\n\n이제 TypeScript는createCardPicker가 Deck 객체에서 호출될 것으로 예상합니다.즉 this는 any가 아닌 Deck 타입입니다. 따라서 --noImplicitThis는 오류를 발생시키지 않습니다.\n콜백에서의 this 매개변수 (this parameters in callbacks)\n함수를 나중에 호출할 라이브러리에 전달할 때 콜백에서 this를 사용하여 오류가 발생할 수도 있습니다.왜냐하면 콜백을 호출하는 라이브러리가 표준 함수처럼 호출하기 때문에 this는 undefined가 될 것입니다.\n때때로 this 매개변수를 사용하여 콜백 오류를 방지할 수도 있습니다.\n첫 번째, 라이브러리 작성자는 콜백 타입에 this를 사용하여 annotate를 달아야 합니다:\ninterface UIElement {\n    addClickListener(onclick: (this: void, e: Event) => void): void;\n}\n\nthis : void는 addClickListener가 onclick이 this 타입을 필요로 하지 않는 함수라는 것을 의미합니다.\n두 번째, this를 사용하여 호출 코드와 함께 annotate를 달아야 합니다:\nclass Handler {\n    info: string;\n    onClickBad(this: Handler, e: Event) {\n        // 이런, 여기서 this를 사용했어요. 이 콜백을 사용하면 충돌으로 런타임 오류가 발생합니다.\n        this.info = e.message;\n    }\n}\nlet h = new Handler();\nuiElement.addClickListener(h.onClickBad); // 오류!\n\nthis가 annotated되어 있으면 onClickBad는 반드시 Handler의 인스턴스에서 호출되어야한다는 것을 명시해야 합니다.그런 다음 TypeScript는 addClickListener에 this : void가 있는 함수가 필요하다는 것을 발견합니다.오류를 해결하려면 this의 타입을 수정하세요:\nclass Handler {\n    info: string;\n    onClickGood(this: void, e: Event) {\n        // this의 타입이 void이기 때문에 여기서는 사용할 수 없습니다!\n        console.log('clicked!');\n    }\n}\nlet h = new Handler();\nuiElement.addClickListener(h.onClickGood);\n\nonClickGood는 this의 타입을 void로 지정하기 때문에 addClickListener에 전달할 수 있습니다.물론 this는 또한 this.info를 사용할 수 없다는 것을 의미합니다.두 가지 모두를 사용하려면 화살표 함수를 사용해야 합니다:\nclass Handler {\n    info: string;\n    onClickGood = (e: Event) => { this.info = e.message }\n}\n\n이것은 화살표 함수가 this를 캡처하지 않기 때문에 효과적입니다.때문에 기대하는 것 같이 항상 this : void를 넘겨줄 수 있습니다.\n단점은 Handler 타입의 객체마다 하나의 화살표 함수가 생성된다는 것입니다.반면에 메서드는 한 번만 만들어지고 핸들러의 프로토 타입에 소속됩니다.이러한 객체는 핸들러 타입의 모든 객체 사이에 공유됩니다.\n오버로드 (Overloads)\nJavaScript는 본질적으로 매우 동적인 언어입니다.단일 JavaScript 함수가 전달된 인수의 형태를 기반으로 서로 다른 타입의 객체를 반환하는 것은 드문 일이 아닙니다.\nlet suits = [\"hearts\", \"spades\", \"clubs\", \"diamonds\"];\n\nfunction pickCard(x): any {\n    // 객체 / 배열로 작업하고 있는지 확인해보세요\n    // 그렇다면 그것들은 덱을 주고 사용자는 카드를 선택할 것입니다.\n    if (typeof x == \"object\") {\n        let pickedCard = Math.floor(Math.random() * x.length);\n        return pickedCard;\n    }\n    // 그렇지 않으면 카드를 선택하게하세요.\n    else if (typeof x == \"number\") {\n        let pickedSuit = Math.floor(x / 13);\n        return { suit: suits[pickedSuit], card: x % 13 };\n    }\n}\n\nlet myDeck = [{ suit: \"diamonds\", card: 2 }, { suit: \"spades\", card: 10 }, { suit: \"hearts\", card: 4 }];\nlet pickedCard1 = myDeck[pickCard(myDeck)];\nalert(\"card: \" + pickedCard1.card + \" of \" + pickedCard1.suit);\n\nlet pickedCard2 = pickCard(15);\nalert(\"card: \" + pickedCard2.card + \" of \" + pickedCard2.suit);\n\n여기서 pickCard 함수는 사용자가 무엇을 전달했는지에 따라 두 개의 서로 다른 내용을 반환합니다.사용자가 deck를 나타내는 객체를 전달하면 함수가 card를 선택합니다.사용자가 card를 선택하면 그들이 선택한 card를 알려줍니다.하지만 이것을 어떻게 타입 시스템에 설명할까요?\n이에 대한 대답은 오버로드 목록과 동일한 함수에 대한 여러 함수 타입을 제공하는 것이다.이 목록은 컴파일러가 함수 호출을 해결하는 데 사용할 것입니다.pickCard가 받아들일 수 있는 것과 그것이 반환하는 것을 기술한 오버로드 목록을 작성해 보세요.\nlet suits = [\"hearts\", \"spades\", \"clubs\", \"diamonds\"];\n\nfunction pickCard(x: {suit: string; card: number; }[]): number;\nfunction pickCard(x: number): {suit: string; card: number; };\nfunction pickCard(x): any {\n    // 객체 / 배열로 작업하고 있는지 확인해보세요\n    // 그렇다면 그것들은 덱을 주고 사용자는 카드를 선택할 것입니다.\n    if (typeof x == \"object\") {\n        let pickedCard = Math.floor(Math.random() * x.length);\n        return pickedCard;\n    }\n    // 그렇지 않으면 카드를 선택하게하세요.\n    else if (typeof x == \"number\") {\n        let pickedSuit = Math.floor(x / 13);\n        return { suit: suits[pickedSuit], card: x % 13 };\n    }\n}\n\nlet myDeck = [{ suit: \"diamonds\", card: 2 }, { suit: \"spades\", card: 10 }, { suit: \"hearts\", card: 4 }];\nlet pickedCard1 = myDeck[pickCard(myDeck)];\nalert(\"card: \" + pickedCard1.card + \" of \" + pickedCard1.suit);\n\nlet pickedCard2 = pickCard(15);\nalert(\"card: \" + pickedCard2.card + \" of \" + pickedCard2.suit);\n\n이런 변화로 인해 오버로드가 pickCard 함수에 대한 타입-체크 호출을 제공합니다.\n컴파일러가 올바른 타입 검사를 선택하기 위해 기본 JavaScript와 비슷한 프로세스를 수행합니다.오버로드 목록을 살펴보고 제공된 매개변수를 사용하여 함수를 호출하는 첫 번째 오버로드 시도를 계속합니다.일치하는 것을 찾으면 이 오버로드를 올바른 오버로드로 선택합니다.이러한 이유 때문에 주문이 많아지면 가장 구체적인 것에서 가장 덜 구체적인 것으로 오버로드합니다.\nfunction pickCard (x) : any 조각은 오버로드 목록의 일부가 아니므로 두 개의 오버로드만 있습니다:하나는 객체를 취하고 하나는 숫자를 취합니다.pickCard를 다른 매개 변수 타입과 함께 호출하면 오류가 발생합니다.\n"},"pages/Generics.html":{"url":"pages/Generics.html","title":"제네릭","keywords":"","body":"소개 (Introduction)\n소프트웨어 공학의 주요 부분은 명확하고 일관된 API를 가질뿐만 아니라 재사용 가능한 구성 요소를 구축하는 것입니다. 현재의 데이터 뿐만 아니라 미래의 데이터에 대해서도 처리할 수 있는 구성 요소는 대형 소프트웨어 시스템 구축을 위한 가장 유연한 기능을 제공할 것입니다.\nC# 및 Java와 같은 언어에서 재사용 가능한 구성 요소를 만들기 위한 주요 도구 중 하나는 제네릭 즉 단일 타입이 아닌 다양한 타입을 처리할 수 있는 구성 요소를 만드는 것입니다. 이를 통해 사용자는 구성요소를 사용할 때 자신만의 타입을 사용할 수 있습니다.\n제네릭의 Hello World (Hello World of Generics)\n우선 제네릭의 \"Hello World\" 즉 identity 함수를 만들어 봅시다. 이 identity 함수는 전달된 것을 그대로 반환하는 함수입니다. 이는 echo 명령과 비슷한 방식으로 생각하면 됩니다.\n제네릭이 없다면 identity 함수에 특정 타입을 부여해야 합니다.\nfunction identity(arg: number): number {\n    return arg;\n}\n\n또는 any 타입을 사용하여 identity 함수를 만들 수 있습니다.\nfunction identity(arg: any): any {\n    return arg;\n}\n\nany를 사용하는 것은 분명히 함수가 arg에 대한 모든 타입을 전달 받을 수 있게되지만 실제로 함수가 반환할 때 그 타입이 무엇이었는지에 대한 정보를 잃어버립니다. 만약 숫자를 인자로 전달하면 어떤 타입이든 반환횔 수 있다는 것을 알 수 있습니다.\n대신 어떤 타입이 반환될 것인지를 나타내는 데 사용할 수 있는 방식으로 인수 타입을 정하는 방법이 필요합니다. 여기서는 값이 아닌 타입을 처리하는 특별한 종류의 변수인 타입 변수(type variable)을 사용할 것입니다.\nfunction identity(arg: T): T {\n    return arg;\n}\n\nidentity 함수에 타입변수 T 를 추가했습니다.\n이 T 는 함수 사용자가 제공한 타입(예: number)를 캡처하여 나중에 해당 정보를 사용할 수 있도록 합니다. 또한 T 를 다시 반환 타입으로 사용합니다. 자세히 보면 인수와 반환 타입에 동일한 타입이 사용되는 것을 볼 수 있습니다. 이를 통해 함수의 안과 밖에서 타입에 대한 정보를 넘길 수 있습니다.\n이러한 모습의 identity 함수는 다양한 타입을 처리할 수 있기 때문에 일반적이라고 할 수 있습니다. any 를 사용하는 것과는 달리 인수와 반환 타입에 숫자를 사용하는 처음의 identity 함수와 동일합니다.(즉 어떠한 정보도 잃어버리지 않습니다)\n제네릭 identity 함수를 만든 후 두 가지 방법 중 하나로 호출 할 수 있습니다. 첫번째 방법은 타입 인수를 포함한 모든 인수를 함수에 전달하는 것입니다.\nlet output = identity(\"myString\");  // 반환 타입은 'string' 입니다.\n\n여기서는 함수 호출에 대한 인수 중 하나인 T 를 string 으로 명시적으로 정했으며 인자에는 () 를 사용하는 것과 달리 <> 를 사용했습니다.\n두번째 방법은 더 일반적인 방법이기도 합니다. 여기서는 타입 인수 추론(type argument inference) 를 사용합니다. 즉 함수에 전달하는 인수 타입에 따라 컴파일러가 자동으로 T 값을 설정합니다.\nlet output = identity(\"myString\");  // 반환 타입은 'string' 입니다.\n\n꺾쇠 괄호(<>) 안에 명시적으로 타입을 전달할 필요가 없습니다. 컴파일러는 그저 \"myString\" 의 값을 보고 T 를 그 타입으로 설정합니다.\n타입 인자 추론은 코드를 더 짧고 가독성 있게 유지하는 유용한 도구가 될 수 있지만 보다 복잡한 예제에서는 컴파일러가 타입을 추론하지 못하면 앞의 예제에서 했던 것 처럼 타입 인자를 명시적으로 전달해야 할 수도 있습니다.\n제네릭 타입 변수 (Generic Type Variables)\n제네릭을 사용하기 시작할 때  identity 와 같은 제네릭 함수를 만들면 컴파일러는 함수 내부에 제네릭으로 타입이 지정된 매개변수를 올바르게 사용하도록 합니다. 즉 실제로 이러한 매개변수를 모든 타입이 될 수 있는 것처럼 취급힙니다.\n앞에서 본 identity 함수를 보겠습니다.\nfunction identity(arg: T): T {\n    return arg;\n}\n\n각 호출과 함께 콘솔에 인수 arg 의 길이를 기록하고 싶다면 어떻게 해야할까요?\n이렇게 할지도 모릅니다:\nfunction loggingIdentity(arg: T): T {\n    console.log(arg.length);  // 오류 : T는 .length 메소드를 가지고 있지 않습니다.\n    return arg;\n}\n\n컴파일러는 arg 의 .length 멤버를 사용하고 있다는 오류를 주지만 arg 모듈에는 이 멤버가 없다고 할 수는 없습니다. 이전에 타입 변수가 모든 타입이 될 수 있다고 했습니다. 따라서 누군가 .length 멤버가 없는 number 를 전달 할 수 있을 것입니다.\n실제로 이 함수가 T 대신 T 배열을 처리한다고 가정해 봅시다. 그러면 배열을 처리할 수 있기 때문에 .length 멤버가 사용 가능해야 합니다. 다른 타입의 배열을 생성하는 함수로 이것을 설명하겠습니다:\nfunction loggingIdentity(arg: T[]): T[] {\n    console.log(arg.length);  // Array는 .length 멤버가 있습니다. 오류 없음.\n    return arg;\n}\n\nloggingIdentity 는 타입 매개 변수 T 를 인자로 받고 arg 는 T 배열이며 T 배열을 반환합니다. 숫자 배열을 인자로 넘기면 T 가 number 에 바인딩 되기 때문에 숫자 배열을 반환할 것입니다. 이렇게하면 모든 타입이 아닌 처리하고자 하는 타입의 일부로 제네릭 타입 변수 T 를 사용하여 유연성을 높일 수 있습니다.\n혹은 다음 예제와 같이 작성할 수 있습니다.\nfunction loggingIdentity(arg: Array): Array {\n    console.log(arg.length);  // Array는 .length 멤버가 있습니다. 오류 없음.\n    return arg;\n}\n\n이미 다른 언어의 타입 스타일에 대해 잘 알고 있을 것입니다. 다음장에서는 Array 와 같이 자신만의 제네릭 타입을 만드는 방법을 다룰 것입니다.\n제네릭 타입 (Generic Types)\n이전 장에서는 다양한 타입의 함수를 처리하는 제네릭 identity 함수를 만들었습니다. 이 장에서는 함수 자체의 타입과 제네릭 인터페이스를 만드는 방법에 대하여 살펴보겠습니다.\n제네릭 함수의 타입은 함수 선언과 비슷하게 타입 매개변수가 먼저 나열된 비 제네릭 함수의 형식과 같습니다.\nfunction identity(arg: T): T {\n    return arg;\n}\n\nlet myIdentity: (arg: T) => T = identity;\n\n타입 변수의 수와 타입 변수의 사용이 일치하다면 제네릭 타입 매개변수에 다른 이름을 사용할 수도 있습니다.\nfunction identity(arg: T): T {\n    return arg;\n}\n\nlet myIdentity: (arg: U) => U = identity;\n\n제네릭 타입을 객체 리터럴 타입의 호출 형식으로도 사용할 수 있습니다:\nfunction identity(arg: T): T {\n    return arg;\n}\n\nlet myIdentity: {(arg: T): T} = identity;\n\n따라서 첫번째 제네릭 인터페이스를 작성하게 됩니다.\n앞의 예제에서 객체 리터럴을 가져와 인터페이스로 옮깁니다.\ninterface GenericIdentityFn {\n    (arg: T): T;\n}\n\nfunction identity(arg: T): T {\n    return arg;\n}\n\nlet myIdentity: GenericIdentityFn = identity;\n\n비슷한 예에서 제네릭 매개변수를 전체 인터페이스의 매개변수로 이동하려고 할 수 있습니다.\n이렇게하면 일반적으로 사용하는 유형(예: Dictionary 가 아닌 Dictionary) 을 볼 수 있습니다. 이것은 인터페이스의 다른 모든 멤버가 타입 매개변수를 볼 수 있게합니다.\ninterface GenericIdentityFn {\n    (arg: T): T;\n}\n\nfunction identity(arg: T): T {\n    return arg;\n}\n\nlet myIdentity: GenericIdentityFn = identity;\n\n예제를 약간 다른 것으로 바꿔보겠습니다.\n제네릭 함수 대신 제네릭 타입의 일부인 비 제네릭 함수 signature로 설명하겠습니다.\n우리가 GenericIdentityFn 을 사용할 때 대응하는 타입 매개변수(여기서는 number)를 지정할 필요가 있고 호출 형식을 효과적으로 고정시킬 것입니다.\n언제 직접 호출 형식에 타입 파라미터를 삽입해야 하고 언제 인터페이스 자체에 삽입해야하는지를 이해하는 것이 타입의 어떤 측면이 제네릭인지 설명하는데 도움이 될 것입니다.\n제네릭 인터페이스 외에도 제네릭 클래스를 만들 수 있습니다.\n하지만 제네릭 열거형과 네임스페이스는 만들 수 없습니다.\n제네릭 클래스 (Generic Classes)\n제네릭 클래스는 제네릭 인터페이스와 형태가 비슷합니다.\n제네릭 클래스는 클래스 이름 다음에 꺾쇠 괄호(<>)로 묶인 제네릭 타입 매개변수들을 갖습니다.\nclass GenericNumber {\n    zeroValue: T;\n    add: (x: T, y: T) => T;\n}\n\nlet myGenericNumber = new GenericNumber();\nmyGenericNumber.zeroValue = 0;\nmyGenericNumber.add = function(x, y) { return x + y;

 // 좋아요\ns = a;  // 좋아요\n\n클래스의 Private와 protected 멤버 (Private and protected members in classes)\n클래스의 Private와 및 protected 멤버는 호환성에 영향을 줍니다.클래스의 인스턴스가 호환성을 검사할 때 대상 타입에 private 멤버가 포함되어 있으면 원본 타입에 동일한 클래스에서 비롯된 private 멤버가 포함되어 있어야합니다.마찬가지로 protected 멤버가 있는 인스턴스에도 동일하게 적용됩니다.이를 통해 클래스는 수퍼 클래스와 할당을 지정하는 것이 가능하지만 다른 상속 계층 구조의 클래스에서는 동일한 형태을 가질 수 없습니다.\n제네릭 (Generics)\nTypeScript는 구조적인 타입 시스템이기 때문에 타입 매개변수는 멤버 타입의 일부로 사용될 때 결과 타입에 만 영향을 줍니다.\n예를 들어\ninterface Empty {\n}\nlet x: Empty;\nlet y: Empty;\n\nx = y;  // 좋아요, y는 x의 구조와 일치합니다\n\n위의 경우 x와 y의 구조가 인수 타입를 차별화된 방식으로 사용하지 않기 때문에 호환 가능합니다.\nEmpty에 멤버를 추가하여 이 예제를 변경하면 어떻게 동작하는지 보여줍니다 :\ninterface NotEmpty {\n    data: T;\n}\nlet x: NotEmpty;\nlet y: NotEmpty;\n\nx = y;  // 오류, x와 y는 호환되지 않습니다\n\n이런 식으로 인수 타입이 명시된 제네릭 타입은 비-제네릭 타입처럼 동작합니다.\n인수 타입 지정되지 않은 제네릭 타입의 경우 모든 지정되지 않은 인수 타입 대신에 any를 지정하여 호환성을 검사합니다.그런 다음 결과로 나타나는 유형의 호환성을 일반적이지 않은 경우와 마찬가지로 검사합니다.그 결과 생성된 타입은 비-제네릭 경우와 마찬가지로 호환성을 검사합니다.\n예를 들어\nlet identity = function(x: T): T {\n    // ...\n}\n\nlet reverse = function(y: U): U {\n    // ...\n}\n\nidentity = reverse;  // 좋아요 왜냐하면 (x: any)=>any 일치 (y: any)=>any\n\n고급 주제 (Advanced Topics)\n하위 타입 vs 할당 (Subtype vs Assignment)\n지금까지는 언어 사양에 정의된 용어가 아닌 '호환성'을 사용했습니다.TypeScript에는 두 종류의 호환성이 있습니다: 하위 타입과 할당\n이러한 할당과 any에서와 숫자 값을 상응하는 열거형까지 할당을 허용하는 규칙과 하위 호환성을 확장에서만 차이가 있다.\n다른 위치는 상황에 따라 두 가지 호환 메커니즘 중 하나를 사용합니다.실용적인 목적을 위해 타입 호환성은 implements와 extends의 경우에도 할당 호환성에 의해 결정됩니다.\n자세한 내용은 TypeScript 사양을 참조하십시오.\n"},"pages/Advanced Types.html":{"url":"pages/Advanced Types.html","title":"고급 타입","keywords":"","body":"교차 타입 (Intersection Types)\n교차 타입은 다양한 타입을 하나로 결합합니다.따라서 기존 타입을 추가하여 필요한 모든 기능을 갖춘 단일 타입을 얻을 수 있습니다.\n예를 들어 Person & Serializable & Loggable은 Person 과 Serializable 이며 Loggable 입니다.즉 이 타입의 객체는 세 가지 타입의 모든 멤버를 갖게됩니다.\n믹스인에 사용되는 교차 타입과 고전적인 객체 지향 형식에 맞지 않는 다른 개념을 볼 수 있습니다.(JavaScript에 이러한 것들이 많습니다!)\n여기에 Mixin을 만드는 방법을 보여 주는 간단한 예제가 있습니다 :\nfunction extend(first: T, second: U): T & U {\n    let result = {};\n    for (let id in first) {\n        (result)[id] = (first)[id];\n    }\n    for (let id in second) {\n        if (!result.hasOwnProperty(id)) {\n            (result)[id] = (second)[id];\n        }\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\nclass Person {\n    constructor(public name: string) { }\n}\ninterface Loggable {\n    log(): void;\n}\nclass ConsoleLogger implements Loggable {\n    log() {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\nvar jim = extend(new Person(\"Jim\"), new ConsoleLogger());\nvar n = jim.name;\njim.log();\n\n유니온 타입 (Union Types)\n유니온 타입은 교차 타입과 밀접한 관련이 있지만 매우 다르게 사용됩니다.때로는 매개 변수가 number 또는string이 될 것으로 기대하는 라이브러리를 실행하게 됩니다.\n예를 들어 다음과 같은 함수을 수행하십시오:\n/**\n * string 타입을 가져와서 왼쪽에 \"padding\"을 추가합니다.\n * 'padding'이 string인 경우에는 'padding'이 왼쪽에 추가됩니다.\n * 'padding'이 number인 경우에는 해당 개수의 공백이 왼쪽에 추가됩니다.\n */\nfunction padLeft(value: string, padding: any) {\n    if (typeof padding === \"number\") {\n        return Array(padding + 1).join(\" \") + value;\n    }\n    if (typeof padding === \"string\") {\n        return padding + value;\n    }\n    throw new Error(`Expected string or number, got '${padding}'.`);\n}\n\npadLeft(\"Hello world\", 4); // \"    Hello world\" 반환\n\npadLeft의 문제점은 padding 매개 변수가 any로 분류된다는 것입니다.즉 number이거나 string이 아닌 인수를 사용하여 호출할 수 있지만 TypeScript는 해당 인수와 함께 사용할 수 있습니다.\nlet indentedString = padLeft(\"Hello world\", true); // 컴파일 타임에는 통과되지만 런타임에는 실패합니다.\n\n전통적인 객체 지향 코드에서는 타입의 계층을 만들어 두 가지 타입을 추상화 할 수 있습니다.이것이 훨씬 더 명백하기는 하지만 또 약간 지나치기도 합니다.padLeft의 원래 버전에 대한 좋은 점 중 하나는 원시 값을 전달할 수 있다는 것입니다.이는 사용법이 간단하고 간결하다는 것을 의미했습니다.이 새로운 접근법은 이미 다른 곳에 있는 함수를 사용하려는 경우에도 도움이 되지 않습니다.\nany 대신 padding 매개변수에 union type 을 사용할 수 있습니다:\n/**\n * string 타입을 가져와서 왼쪽에 \"padding\"을 추가합니다.\n * 'padding'이 string인 경우에는 'padding'이 왼쪽에 추가됩니다.\n * 'padding'이 number인 경우에는 해당 개수의 공백이 왼쪽에 추가됩니다.\n */\nfunction padLeft(value: string, padding: string | number) {\n    // ...\n}\n\nlet indentedString = padLeft(\"Hello world\", true); // 컴파일 시 오류\n\n유니온 타입은 여러 타입 중 하나일 수 있는 값을 설명합니다.각 타입을 구분하기 위해 수직 막대(|)를 사용하므로 number | string | boolean은 number, string 또는 boolean 될 수 있는 값의 타입입니다.\n유니온 타입이 있는 값이 있으면 유니온의 모든 타입에 공통적인 멤버에만 접근할 수 있습니다.\ninterface Bird {\n    fly();\n    layEggs();\n}\n\ninterface Fish {\n    swim();\n    layEggs();\n}\n\nfunction getSmallPet(): Fish | Bird {\n    // ...\n}\n\nlet pet = getSmallPet();\npet.layEggs(); // 좋아요\npet.swim();    // 오류\n\n유니온 타입이 좀 까다로울 수도 있지만 익숙해지는 데는 약간의 직관이 필요할 뿐입니다.어떠한 값에 A | B 타입이 있다면 A 와 B 모두 가지고 있는 멤버가 있음을 확실히 알고 있습니다.이 예제에서 Bird는 fly라는 멤버를 가지고 있습니다.하지만 Bird | Fish의 변수 타입이 fly 메서드로 작용하고 있는지는 알 수 없습니다.런타임에 변수가 Fish 인경우 pet.fly() 호출은 실패합니다.\n타입 가드와 차별된 타입 (Type Guards and Differentiating Types)\n유니온 타입은 값을 취할 수있는 타입으로 겹칠 수있는 상황을 모델링 할 때 유용합니다.Fish를 가지고 있는지에 대해 구체적으로 알아야 할 필요가 있을 때 무슨 일이 일어날까요?JavaScript에서 두 가지 가능한 값을 구별하는 일반적인 용어는 멤버의 존재를 확인하는 것입니다.\n언급했듯이 유니온 타입의 모든 구성 요소에 포함될 수 있는 보장된 멤버에만 접근할 수 있습니다.\nlet pet = getSmallPet();\n\n// 이러한 각 프로퍼티 접근은 오류를 발생시킵니다.\nif (pet.swim) {\n    pet.swim();\n}\nelse if (pet.fly) {\n    pet.fly();\n}\n\n동일한 코드가 작동하도록 하려면 타입 단언을 사용해야 합니다 :\nlet pet = getSmallPet();\n\nif ((pet).swim) {\n    (pet).swim();\n}\nelse {\n    (pet).fly();\n}\n\n사용자 정의 타입 가드 (User-Defined Type Guards)\n타입 단언(type assertions)을 여러 번 사용해야 했다는 것에 주목하세요.일단 이 검사를 실시하면 각 지점에서 pet의 타입를 알 수 있습니다.\n그런 일이 있을 때 TypeScript에는 type guard라는 것이 있습니다.타입 가드(type guard)는 일부 스코프에서 타입을 보장하는 런타임 검사를 수행하는 표현식입니다.타입 가드를 정의하려면 반환 타입이 타입 명제 (type predicate) 인 함수를 정의하기만 하면 됩니다 :\nfunction isFish(pet: Fish | Bird): pet is Fish {\n    return (pet).swim !== undefined;\n}\n\npet is Fish는 이 예제에서 타입 명제입니다.명제는 parameterName is Type 형태을 취합니다, 여기서 parameterName은 현재 함수 시그니처의 매개 변수 이름이어야 합니다.\nIsFish가 일부 변수와 함께 호출될 때 원래 타입이 호환 가능하다면 TypeScript는 그 변수를 특정 타입으로 제한할 것입니다.\n// 'swim'과 'fly' 호출은 이제 모두 괜찮습니다.\n\nif (isFish(pet)) {\n    pet.swim();\n}\nelse {\n    pet.fly();\n}\n\nTypeScript는 pet이 if 스코프의 Fish라는 것을 알고 있을 뿐만 아니라,else 스코프에서는 Fish가 없다는 것을 알기 때문에 Bird가 있어야 합니다.\ntypeof 타입 가드 (typeof type guards)\n그럼 다시 돌아와 유니온 타입을 사용하는 padLeft 버전의 코드를 작성해보겠습니다.다음과 같이 타입 명제로 작성할 수 있습니다 :\nfunction isNumber(x: any): x is number {\n    return typeof x === \"number\";\n}\n\nfunction isString(x: any): x is string {\n    return typeof x === \"string\";\n}\n\nfunction padLeft(value: string, padding: string | number) {\n    if (isNumber(padding)) {\n        return Array(padding + 1).join(\" \") + value;\n    }\n    if (isString(padding)) {\n        return padding + value;\n    }\n    throw new Error(`Expected string or number, got '${padding}'.`);\n}\n\n그러나 어떤 타입이 원시적인지 알아내는 함수를 정의하는 것은 고통스럽습니다.다행스럽게도, typeScript가 자체적으로 타입 가드임을 인식하기 때문에 typeof x === \"number\"를 직접 함수로 추상화할 필요는 없습니다.즉 이러한 인라인 검사를 작성할 수 있다는 것을 의미합니다.\nfunction padLeft(value: string, padding: string | number) {\n    if (typeof padding === \"number\") {\n        return Array(padding + 1).join(\" \") + value;\n    }\n    if (typeof padding === \"string\") {\n        return padding + value;\n    }\n    throw new Error(`Expected string or number, got '${padding}'.`);\n}\n\n이것들의 typeof 타입 가드는 두가지 다른 형태로 인식됩니다: typeof v === \"typename\"와  typeof v !== \"typename\", 여기서  \"typename\"은 반드시 \"number\", \"string\", \"boolean\", 또는 \"symbol\".TypeScript에서 다른 문자열과 비교하는 것을 멈추지는 않지만 언어에서는 이러한 표현식을 타입 가드로 인식하지 않습니다.\ninstanceof 타입 가드 (instanceof type guards)\ntypeof 타입 가드를 읽었고 JavaScript에서 instanceof 연산자에 익숙하다면 아마 이 섹션에 대해 알 수 있을 것입니다.\ninstanceof 타입 가드는 생성자 함수를 사용하여 타입을 좁히는 방법입니다.예를 들어, 이전의 string-padder 예제를 차용해보겠습니다:\ninterface Padder {\n    getPaddingString(): string\n}\n\nclass SpaceRepeatingPadder implements Padder {\n    constructor(private numSpaces: number) { }\n    getPaddingString() {\n        return Array(this.numSpaces + 1).join(\" \");\n    }\n}\n\nclass StringPadder implements Padder {\n    constructor(private value: string) { }\n    getPaddingString() {\n        return this.value;\n    }\n}\n\nfunction getRandomPadder() {\n    return Math.random() \ninstanceof의 오른쪽에는 생성자 함수가 있어야 하며 TypeScript는 다음과 같이 범위를 좁혀 나갑니다:\n\n타입이 any가 아닌 경우 함수의 prototype 프로퍼티 타입\n해당 타입의 생성자 시그니처에 의해 반환된 타입의 결합\n\n이와 같은 순서로 진행됩니다.\nNullable types\nTypeScript는 null과 undefined 값을 가지는 두 가지 특별한 타입이 있습니다.이것을 기본 타입 섹션에서 간략하게 언급했었습니다.기본적으로 타입 체커는 null과 undefined를 모든 항목에 할당 가능한 것으로 간주합니다.사실상 null 과 undefined는 모든 타입의 유효한 값입니다.즉 방지하려는 경우조차도 any 타입에 할당되지 않도록 할 수 없습니다.null의 발명가 토니 호어는 이것을 \"10억 달러의 실수\"라고 부릅니다.\n--strictNullChecks에서 다음과 같이 수정할 수 있습니다: 변수를 선언할 때 자동으로 null 또는 undefined가 포함되지 않습니다.유니온 타입을 사용하여 명시적으로 포함할 수 있습니다:\nlet s = \"foo\";\ns = null; // 오류, 'null'은 'string'에 할당할 수 없습니다.\nlet sn: string | null = \"bar\";\nsn = null; // 좋아요\n\nsn = undefined; // 오류, 'undefined'는 'string | null'에 할당할 수 없습니다.\n\nTypeScript는 JavaScript의 의미론과 일치하도록 null과 undefined를 다르게 다루고 있습니다.string | null은 string | undefined 및 string | undefined | null과는 다른 타입입니다.\n선택적 매개변수와 프로퍼티 (Optional parameters and properties)\n--strictNullChecks와 선택적 매개 변수는 자동으로 | undefined를 추가합니다:\nfunction f(x: number, y?: number) {\n    return x + (y || 0);\n}\nf(1, 2);\nf(1);\nf(1, undefined);\nf(1, null); // 오류, 'null'은 'number | undefined'에 할당할 수 없습니다\n\n선택적 프로퍼티의 경우에도 동일합니다:\nclass C {\n    a: number;\n    b?: number;\n}\nlet c = new C();\nc.a = 12;\nc.a = undefined; // 오류, 'undefined'를 'number'에 할당 할 수 없습니다\nc.b = 13;\nc.b = undefined; // ok\nc.b = null; // 오류, 'null'은 'number | undefined'에 할당할 수 없습니다\n\n타입 가드와 타입 단언 (Type guards and type assertions)\nnullable 타입은 유니온으로 구현되기 때문에 타입 가드를 사용하여 null을 제거해야 합니다.다행히 JavaScript에서 작성하는 코드는 다음과 같습니다:\nfunction f(sn: string | null): string {\n    if (sn == null) {\n        return \"default\";\n    }\n    else {\n        return sn;\n    }\n}\n\n여기서 null을 제거하는 것은 확실히 좋지만 간단한 연산자도 사용할 수 있습니다.:\nfunction f(sn: string | null): string {\n    return sn || \"default\";\n}\n\n컴파일러가 null 또는 undefined를 제거 할 수 없는 경우 타입 단언 연산자를 사용하여 수동으로 제거할 수 있습니다.구문은 후위에 ! 입니다: identifier!는 identifier의 타입 null과 undefined를 제거합니다:\nfunction broken(name: string | null): string {\n  function postfix(epithet: string) {\n    return name.charAt(0) + '.  the ' + epithet; // 오류, 'name'이 null일 수 있습니다.\n  }\n  name = name || \"Bob\";\n  return postfix(\"great\");\n}\n\nfunction fixed(name: string | null): string {\n  function postfix(epithet: string) {\n    return name!.charAt(0) + '.  the ' + epithet; // 좋아요\n  }\n  name = name || \"Bob\";\n  return postfix(\"great\");\n}\n\n이 예제에서 컴파일러가 중첩된 함수 내에서 null을 제거할 수 없기 때문에 여기에 중첩된 함수를 사용합니다(즉시실행함수 제외).특히 외부 함수에서 호출한 경우 중첩된 함수에 대한 모든 호출을 추적할 수 없기 때문입니다.함수가 어디에서 호출되는지 알지 못하면 body가 실행될 때 name의 타입이 무엇인지 알 수 없습니다.\n타입 별칭 (Type Aliases)\n타입 aliases는 타입의 새로운 이름을 생성합니다.타입 aliases은 인터페이스와 유사하지만 원시 타입, 유니온, 튜플 및 기타 직접 작성해야 하는 다른 타입의 이름을 지정할 수 있습니다.\ntype Name = string;\ntype NameResolver = () => string;\ntype NameOrResolver = Name | NameResolver;\nfunction getName(n: NameOrResolver): Name {\n    if (typeof n === \"string\") {\n        return n;\n    }\n    else {\n        return n();\n    }\n}\n\nAliasing(Type Aliases)은 실제로 새로운 타입을 생성하지는 않습니다 - 그 타입을 참조하기 위해 새로운 이름을 생성합니다.원시 값을 Aliasing 하는 것은 문서의 형태로 사용될 수 있지만 굉장히 유용하지 않습니다.\n인터페이스와 마찬가지로 타입 aliases도 일반적일 수 있습니다 - aliases 선언의 오른쪽에 타입 매개 변수를 추가하여 사용하면 됩니다:\ntype Container = { value: T };\n\ntype alias를 프로퍼티에서 참조할 수도 있습니다:\ntype Tree = {\n    value: T;\n    left: Tree;\n    right: Tree;\n}\n\n교차(intersection) 타입과 함께 mind-bending 타입을 만들 수 있습니다:\ntype LinkedList = T & { next: LinkedList };\n\ninterface Person {\n    name: string;\n}\n\nvar people: LinkedList;\nvar s = people.name;\nvar s = people.next.name;\nvar s = people.next.next.name;\nvar s = people.next.next.next.name;\n\n그러나 타입 alias가 선언의 다른 오른쪽에 나타나는 것은 불가능합니다:\ntype Yikes = Array; // 오류\n\nInterfaces vs. Type Aliases\n앞서 언급했듯이, 타입 type aliases는 인터페이스와 같은 역할을 할 수 있지만 몇 가지 미묘한 차이점이 있습니다.\n한가지 다른 점은 인터페이스가 어디에서나 사용되는 새로운 이름을 만들어 낸다는 것입니다.타입 aliases는 새로운 이름을 만들지 않습니다— 예를 들어 오류 메시지는 alias 이름을 사용하지 않습니다.아래 코드에서, 에디터의 interfaced 위로 마우스를 가져가면 Interface를 반환할 것을 보여주지만 aliased는 객체 리터럴 타입을 반환한다는 것을 보여줍니다.\ntype Alias = { num: number }\ninterface Interface {\n    num: number;\n}\ndeclare function aliased(arg: Alias): Alias;\ndeclare function interfaced(arg: Interface): Interface;\n\n두 번째 더 중요한 차이점은 타입 aliases를 다음에서 확장하거나 구현할 수 없다는 것입니다 (다른 타입을 확장/구현할 수도 없습니다).왜냐하면 소프트웨어의 이상적인 특성이 확장에 열려있다 가능한 경우 타입 alias에 대한 인터페이스를 사용해야 합니다.다른 한편으로는, 인터페이스로 일부 형태를 표현할 수 없고 유니온이나 튜플 타입을 사용해야 하는 경우 타입 aliases을 사용하는 것이 보통 좋습니다.\n문자열 리터럴 타입 (String Literal Types)\n문자열 리터럴 타입을 사용하여 문자열에 필요한 정확한 값을 지정할 수 있습니다.실제로 문자열 리터럴 타입은 유니온 타입, 타입 가드 및 타입 aliases와 잘 결합됩니다.이러한 기능을 함께 사용하여 문자열에서 열거형과 같은 동작을 얻을 수 있습니다.\ntype Easing = \"ease-in\" | \"ease-out\" | \"ease-in-out\";\nclass UIElement {\n    animate(dx: number, dy: number, easing: Easing) {\n        if (easing === \"ease-in\") {\n            // ...\n        }\n        else if (easing === \"ease-out\") {\n        }\n        else if (easing === \"ease-in-out\") {\n        }\n        else {\n            // 오류! null 또는 undefined로 통과해서는 안 됩니다.\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nlet button = new UIElement();\nbutton.animate(0, 0, \"ease-in\");\nbutton.animate(0, 0, \"uneasy\"); // 오류: 여기서 \"uneasy\"가 허용되지 않습니다.\n\n허용되는 세 문자열 중 아무거나 전달할 수 있지만 다른 문자열은 오류를 제공합니다.\n'\"uneasy\"' 타입의 인수를 타입의 매개 변수에 지정할 수 없습니다.

TypeScript는 현재 존재하는 JavaScript 패턴을 기반으로 합니다.세가지 구성요소가 있습니다:\n\n공통적인 싱글톤 타입의 특성을 갖는 타입 — discriminant.\n이러한 타입의 합집합을 취하는 타입 별칭 — union.\n공통 프로퍼티에 타입 가드.\n\ninterface Square {\n    kind: \"square\";\n    size: number;\n}\ninterface Rectangle {\n    kind: \"rectangle\";\n    width: number;\n    height: number;\n}\ninterface Circle {\n    kind: \"circle\";\n    radius: number;\n}\n\n먼저 결합할 인터페이스를 선언합니다.각 인터페이스는 다른 문자열 리터럴 타입을 가진 kind 프로퍼티를 가지고 있습니다.kind 프로퍼티는 discriminant 또는 tag라고 부릅니다.다른 프로퍼티는 각 인터페이스에 고유합니다.인터페이스는 현재 관련이 없습니다.그것들을 결합하여 넣습니다:\ntype Shape = Square | Rectangle | Circle;\n\n이제 식별 유니온을 사용합니다:\nfunction area(s: Shape) {\n    switch (s.kind) {\n        case \"square\": return s.size * s.size;\n        case \"rectangle\": return s.height * s.width;\n        case \"circle\": return Math.PI * s.radius ** 2;\n    }\n}\n\n철저한 검사 (Exhaustiveness checking)\n식별 유니온의 모든 변형을 다루지 않을 때 컴파일러에서 알려주면 좋겠습니다.예를 들어 Shape에 Triangle을 추가하면 area도 업데이트해야 합니다:\ntype Shape = Square | Rectangle | Circle | Triangle;\nfunction area(s: Shape) {\n    switch (s.kind) {\n        case \"square\": return s.size * s.size;\n        case \"rectangle\": return s.height * s.width;\n        case \"circle\": return Math.PI * s.radius ** 2;\n    }\n    // 여기서 오류가 발생해야합니다 - \"triangle\"을 핸들링하지 않았습니다\n}\n\n두 가지 방법이 있습니다.\n첫 번째는 --strictNullChecks를 켜고 반환 타입을 지정하는 것입니다 :\nfunction area(s: Shape): number { // 오류: returns number | undefined\n    switch (s.kind) {\n        case \"square\": return s.size * s.size;\n        case \"rectangle\": return s.height * s.width;\n        case \"circle\": return Math.PI * s.radius ** 2;\n    }\n}\n\nswitch가 더 이상 완전하지 않기 때문에 TypeScript는 그 함수가 때때로 undefined를 반환할 수 있다는 것을 알고 있습니다.명시적 반환 타입 number를 가지고 있다면 반환 타입이 실제로 number | undefined라는 오류가 발생합니다.그러나 이 방법은 매우 미묘하며 --strictNullChecks가 오래된 코드에서 항상 작동하는 것은 아닙니다.\n두 번째 방법은 컴파일러가 철저히 검사하기 위해 never 타입을 사용한다는 점입니다.\nfunction assertNever(x: never): never {\n    throw new Error(\"Unexpected object: \" + x);\n}\nfunction area(s: Shape) {\n    switch (s.kind) {\n        case \"square\": return s.size * s.size;\n        case \"rectangle\": return s.height * s.width;\n        case \"circle\": return Math.PI * s.radius ** 2;\n        default: return assertNever(s); // 누락된 경우 여기에 오류가 발생합니다\n    }\n}\n\n여기서, assertNever는 s가 never 타입인지 확인합니다 — 다른 모든 case가 종료된 후에 남겨진 타입이 제거되었습니다.case를 잊어버리면 s가 실제 타입을 가지게되고 타입 에러가 생깁니다.이 방법을 사용하려면 추가 함수을 정의해야 하지만 잊어버렸을 때 훨씬 더 분명해집니다.\n다형성의 this 타입 (Polymorphic this types)\n다형성의this 타입은 포함된 클래스나 인터페이스의 서브타입 타입을 나타냅니다.이것을 F-바운드 다형성이라고 합니다.\n따라서 계층적으로 완만한 인터페이스를 훨씬 쉽게 표현할 수 있습니다.각각의 연산자에 this를 반환하는 간단한 계산기가 있습니다:\nclass BasicCalculator {\n    public constructor(protected value: number = 0) { }\n    public currentValue(): number {\n        return this.value;\n    }\n    public add(operand: number): this {\n        this.value += operand;\n        return this;\n    }\n    public multiply(operand: number): this {\n        this.value *= operand;\n        return this;\n    }\n    // ... 다른 연산은 여기에 있습니다 ...\n}\n\nlet v = new BasicCalculator(2)\n            .multiply(5)\n            .add(1)\n            .currentValue();\n\n클래스는 this 타입을 사용하기 때문에 확장할 수 있으며 새로운 클래스는 변경 없이 이전 메소드를 사용할 수 있습니다.\nclass ScientificCalculator extends BasicCalculator {\n    public constructor(value = 0) {\n        super(value);\n    }\n    public sin() {\n        this.value = Math.sin(this.value);\n        return this;\n    }\n    // ... 다른 연산은 여기에 있습니다 ...\n}\n\nlet v = new ScientificCalculator(2)\n        .multiply(5)\n        .sin()\n        .add(1)\n        .currentValue();\n\nthis 타입이 없었다면 ScientificCalculator는 BasicCalculator를 확장하지도 못하고 완만한 인터페이스를 유지할 수 없었을 것입니다.multiply는 sin 메서드가 없는BasicCalculator를 반환했을 것입니다.그러나 this 타입의 경우 multiply는 this를 리턴합니다. this는 ScientificCalculator입니다.\n인덱스 타입 (Index types)\n인덱스 타입을 사용하면 동적 프로퍼티 이름을 사용하는 코드를 컴파일러가 검사하도록 할 수 있습니다.\n예를 들어 일반적인 Javascript 패턴은 객체에서 프로퍼티의 하위 집합을 선택하는 것입니다:\nfunction pluck(o, names) {\n    return names.map(n => o[n]);\n}\n\n다음은 인덱스 타입 쿼리 및 인덱스 접근 연산자를 사용하여 TypeScript에서 이 함수를 작성하고 사용하는 방법입니다.\nfunction pluck(o: T, names: K[]): T[K][] {\n  return names.map(n => o[n]);\n}\n\ninterface Person {\n    name: string;\n    age: number;\n}\nlet person: Person = {\n    name: 'Jarid',\n    age: 35\n};\nlet strings: string[] = pluck(person, ['name']); // 좋아요, string[]\n\n컴파일러는 name이 실제로 Person의 프로퍼티인지 확인합니다.이 예제는 몇 가지 새로운 타입의 연산자를 소개합니다.\n첫 번째는 keyof T으로 인덱스 타입 쿼리 연산자입니다.어떤 타입의 T에 대해서 keyof T는 T의 알려진 public 프로퍼티 이름들의 유니온입니다.\n예를 들어:\nlet personProps: keyof Person; // 'name' | 'age'\n\nkeyof Person은 'name' | 'age'와 완전히 호환됩니다.차이점은 Person에 또 다른 프로퍼티인 address: string을 추가하면 keyof Person은 자동으로 'name' | 'age' | 'address'로 업데이트된다는 점이다.그리고 pluck과 같은 일반적인 컨텍스트에서 keyof를 사용할 수 있으며 이때 프로퍼티 이름을 미리 알 수는 없습니다.즉 컴파일러가 올바른 프로퍼티 이름을 pluck으로 전달했는지 확인합니다:\npluck(person, ['age', 'unknown']); // 오류, 'unknown'은 'name' | 'age'에 없습니다\n\n두 번째 연산자는 T[K], 인덱스 접근 연산자(indexed access operator) 입니다.\n여기서 타입의 구문은 표현식을 반영합니다.\n즉 person['name']은 Person['name']타입을 가집니다 —\n예제에서는 단지 string입니다.\n하지만 인덱스 타입 쿼리와 마찬가지로 T[K]를 사용하면 실질적으로 힘이 발휘되는 일반적인 컨텍스트에서 사용할 수 있습니다.타입 변수 K extends keyof T를 확실히 만들어야 합니다.여기 getProperty라는 함수가 있는 또 다른 예제가 있습니다.\nfunction getProperty(o: T, name: K): T[K] {\n    return o[name]; // o[name]은 T[K] 타입입니다\n}\n\ngetProperty에서, o: T와 name: K는 o[name]: T[K]를 의미합니다.일단 T[K] 결과를 반환하면 컴파일러는 실제 키의 타입을 인스턴스화하므로 getProperty의 반환 타입은 사용자가 요청하는 프로퍼티에 따라 달라집니다.\nlet name: string = getProperty(person, 'name');\nlet age: number = getProperty(person, 'age');\nlet unknown = getProperty(person, 'unknown'); // 오류, 'unknown'은 'name' | 'age'에 없습니다\n\n인덱스 타입과 문자열 인덱스 시그니처 (Index types and string index signatures)\nkeyof와 T[K]는 문자열 인덱스 시그니처과 상호 작용합니다.문자열 인덱스 시그니처을 가진 타입을 가지고 있다면 keyof T는 단지string이 될 것입니다.그리고 T[string]은 인덱스 시그니처의 한가지 종류일뿐입니다:\ninterface Map {\n    [key: string]: T;\n}\nlet keys: keyof Map; // string\nlet value: Map['foo']; // number\n\nMapped types\n일반적인 작업은 기존 타입을 선택하고 각 프로퍼티를 선택적으로 만드는 것입니다:\ninterface PersonPartial {\n    name?: string;\n    age?: number;\n}\n\n또는 readonly를 원할 수도 있습니다.\ninterface PersonReadonly {\n    readonly name: string;\n    readonly age: number;\n}\n\n이러한 일은 Javascript에서 자주 발생하여 TypeScript는 이전 타입인 — mapped types 타입을 기반으로 새로운 타입을 만드는 방법을 제공합니다.mapped type에서 새로운 타입은 이전 타입의 각 프로퍼티를 동일한 방식으로 변환합니다.예를 들어 모든 프로퍼티 타입을 readonly 또는 선택적으로 설정할 수 있습니다.아래 몇 가지 예제가 있습니다:\ntype Readonly = {\n    readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P];\n}\ntype Partial = {\n    [P in keyof T]?: T[P];\n}\n\n그리고 그것을 사용하려면:\ntype PersonPartial = Partial;\ntype ReadonlyPerson = Readonly;\n\n가장 간단한 mapped type과 해당 부분을 살펴보겠습니다:\ntype Keys = 'option1' | 'option2';\ntype Flags = { [K in Keys]: boolean };\n\n구문은 인덱스 시그니처을 위한 구문과 for .. in 내부가 유사하게 사용됩니다.세 가지 파트로 나뉩니다:\n\n변수의 타입 K는 각 프로퍼티에 차례대로 바인딩 됩니다.\n문자열 리터럴 유니온 Keys는 반복할 프로퍼티의 이름을 포함합니다.\n결과적으로 생성된 프로퍼티의 타입.\n\n이 간단한 예제에서 Keys는 하드 코딩된 프로퍼티 이름의 리스트이고 프로퍼티 타입은 항상 boolean이므로 mapped type은 작성된 것과 같습니다.\ntype Flags = {\n    option1: boolean;\n    option2: boolean;\n}\n\n그러나 실제 애플리케이션은 위의 Readonly 또는 Partial처럼 보입니다.기존의 타입을 기반으로 하며 어떤 방식으로든 필드를 변환합니다.즉 keyof와 인덱스 접근 타입이 들어있는 곳입니다:\ntype NullablePerson = { [P in keyof Person]: Person[P] | null }\ntype PartialPerson = { [P in keyof Person]?: Person[P] }\n\n하지만 일반적인 버전을 사용하는 것이 더 유용합니다.\ntype Nullable = { [P in keyof T]: T[P] | null }\ntype Partial = { [P in keyof T]?: T[P] }\n\n이 예제에서 프로퍼티 목록은 keyof T이며 결과 타입은 T[P]의 변형입니다.이것은 mapped types의 일반적인 사용을 위한 좋은 템플릿입니다.왜냐하면 이러한 종류의 변환은 유사 동형(homomorphic)이기 때문에 매핑은 T의 프로퍼티에만 적용되고 다른 프로퍼티에는 적용되지 않습니다.컴파일러는 새로운 프로퍼티를 추가하기 전에 기존의 프로퍼티 지정자를 모두 복사할 수 있다는 것을 알고 있습니다.예를 들어 Person.name이 읽기 전용인 경우 Partial.name은 읽기 전용 및 선택적입니다.다음은 T[P]가 Proxy 클래스에 래핑된 또 하나의 예제입니다:\ntype Proxy = {\n    get(): T;\n    set(value: T): void;\n}\ntype Proxify = {\n    [P in keyof T]: Proxy;\n}\nfunction proxify(o: T): Proxify {\n   // ... proxies 감싸기 ...\n}\nlet proxyProps = proxify(props);\n\nReadonly와 Partial는 매우 유용하기 때문에 TypeScript의 표준 라이브러리에 Pick과 Record와 함께 포함되어 있습니다:\ntype Pick = {\n    [P in K]: T[P];\n}\ntype Record = {\n    [P in K]: T;\n}\n\nReadonly, Partial과 Pick은 동형(homomorphic)인 반면 Record는 그렇지 않습니다.Record가 동형(homomorphic)이 아닌 한가지 단서는 프로퍼티를 복사하는 데 입력 타입을 사용하지 않는다는 점입니다:\ntype ThreeStringProps = Record\n\n동형이 아닌 타입은 본질적으로 새로운 프로퍼티를 생성하기 때문에 어디에서나 프로퍼티 지정자를 복사할 수 없습니다.\nmapped types의 추론 (Inference from mapped types)\n이제는 타입의 프로퍼티를 래핑하는 방법을 알았으므로 다음으로 해야 할 일은 언래핑(푸는) 것입니다.다행히도 꽤 쉽습니다 :\nfunction unproxify(t: Proxify): T {\n    let result = {} as T;\n    for (const k in t) {\n        result[k] = t[k].get();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\nlet originalProps = unproxify(proxyProps);\n\n이 언래핑 추론은 동형 매핑 타입에서만 작동합니다.매핑된 타입이 동형이 아닌 경우에는 언래핑 함수에 명시적 타입 매개 변수를 지정해야 합니다.\n"},"pages/Symbols.html":{"url":"pages/Symbols.html","title":"심볼","keywords":"","body":"소개 (Introduction)\nECMAScript 2015에서 시작된 symbol은 number와 string같은 primitive 데이터 타입입니다.\nsymbol 값은 Symbol 생성자를 호출하여 생성됩니다.\nlet sym1 = Symbol();\n\nlet sym2 = Symbol(\"key\");

// \"123\"\n\nexport = and import = require()\nCommonJS와 AMD 모두 일반적으로 모듈의 모든 exports를 포함하는 exports 객체 개념을 가지고 있습니다.\n또한 exports 객체를 커스텀 단일 객체로 대체하는 것을 지원합니다.Default exports는이 동작을 대신하는 역할을 합니다.그러나 그 둘은 호환되지 않습니다.TypeScript는 기존의 CommonJS와 AMD 워크플로우를 모델링하기 위해 export =를 지원합니다.\nexport = 구문은 모듈에서 export된 단일 객체를 지정합니다.\n클래스, 인터페이스, 네임스페이스, 함수 또는 열거형이 될 수 있습니다.\nexport =를 사용하여 모듈을 import 할 때 모듈을 import 하기 위해 TypeScript에 특정한 import module = require(\"module\")을 사용해야합니다.\nZipCodeValidator.ts\nlet numberRegexp = /^[0-9]+$/;\nclass ZipCodeValidator {\n    isAcceptable(s: string) {\n        return s.length === 5 && numberRegexp.test(s);\n    }\n}\nexport = ZipCodeValidator;\n\nTest.ts\nimport zip = require(\"./ZipCodeValidator\");\n\n// 시험용 샘플\nlet strings = [\"Hello\", \"98052\", \"101\"];\n\n// 사용할 Validators\nlet validator = new zip();\n\n// 각 문자열이 각 Validator를 통과했는지 여부를 보여줍니다.\nstrings.forEach(s => {\n  console.log(`\"${ s }\" - ${ validator.isAcceptable(s) ? \"matches\" : \"does not match\" }`);\n});\n\n모듈을 위한 코드 생성 (Code Generation for Modules)\n컴파일시 지정된 모듈 대상에 따라 컴파일러는 Node.js (CommonJS), require.js (AMD), UMD, SystemJS 또는 ECMAScript 2015 네이티브 모듈 (ES6)에 적절한 코드를 생성합니다.생성된 코드에서 define, require 및 register 호출에 대한 자세한 정보는 각 모듈 로더에 대한 문서를 참조하세요.\n이 간단한 예제는 import 및 export 중에 사용되는 이름이 모듈 로딩 코드로 어떻게 변환되는지 보여줍니다.\nSimpleModule.ts\nimport m = require(\"mod\");\nexport let t = m.something + 1;\n\nAMD / RequireJS SimpleModule.js\ndefine([\"require\", \"exports\", \"./mod\"], function (require, exports, mod_1) {\n    exports.t = mod_1.something + 1;\n});\n\nCommonJS / Node SimpleModule.js\nvar mod_1 = require(\"./mod\");\nexports.t = mod_1.something + 1;\n\nUMD SimpleModule.js\n(function (factory) {\n    if (typeof module === \"object\" && typeof module.exports === \"object\") {\n        var v = factory(require, exports);

또는 import * as URL from \"url\"\n를 사용하여 모듈을 적재할 수 있습니다.\n/// \nimport * as URL from \"url\";\nlet myUrl = URL.parse(\"http://www.typescriptlang.org\");\n\nShorthand ambient modules\n새로운 모듈을 사용하기 전에 선언을 작성하는 시간을 내고 싶지 않다면 shorthand 선언을 사용하여 빠르게 시작할 수 있습니다.\ndeclarations.d.ts\ndeclare module \"hot-new-module\";\n\nshorthand 모듈의 모든 imports는 any 타입을 가집니다.\nimport x, {y} from \"hot-new-module\";\nx(y);\n\nWildcard module declarations\nSystemJS 및 AMD 같은 일부 모듈 로더들은 JavaScript가 아닌 컨텐츠를 import 할 수 있습니다.일반적으로 특별한 로드의 의미론을 나타내는 접두사 또는 접미사를 사용한다.이러한 경우를 다루기 위해 Wildcard 모듈 선언을 사용할 수 있습니다.\ndeclare module \"*!text\" {\n    const content: string;\n    export default content;\n}\n// 일부는 그 반대의 방법을 사용합니다.\ndeclare module \"json!*\" {\n    const value: any;\n    export default value;\n}\n\n이제 \"*!text\" 또는 \"json!*\" 과 일치하는 것을 import 할 수 있습니다.\nimport fileContent from \"./xyz.txt!text\";\nimport data from \"json!http://example.com/data.json\";\nconsole.log(data, fileContent);\n\nUMD modules\n일부 라이브러리는 많은 모듈 로더에서 사용하도록 설계되었거나 모듈 로드가 없습니다 (글로벌 변수).이러한 모듈을 UMD 모듈이라고 합니다.이러한 라이브러리는 import 또는 글로벌 변수를 통해 접근할 수 있습니다.\n예를 들면:\nmath-lib.d.ts\nexport function isPrime(x: number): boolean;\nexport as namespace mathLib;\n\n그러면 라이브러리를 모듈에서 import로 사용할 수 있습니다.\nimport { isPrime } from \"math-lib\";\nisPrime(2);\nmathLib.isPrime(2); // 오류: 모듈 내부에서 전역 정의를 할 수 없습니다.\n\n글로벌 변수로 사용할 수도 있지만 스크립트 내부에서만 사용할 수 있습니다.(스크립트는 imports 또는 exports가 없는 파일입니다)\nmathLib.isPrime(2);\n\n모듈 구조화를 위한 가이드 (Guidance for structuring modules)\n최상위 레벨에 가깝게 내보내기 (Export as close to top-level as possible)\n모듈의 사용자들은 export 한 것들을 사용할 때 가능한 한 마찰이 적어야 합니다.너무 많은 중첩의 레벨을 추가하는 것은 다루기 힘들기 때문에 구조화 방법에 대해 신중히 생각하세요.\n모듈에서 네임스페이스를 export 하는 것은 중첩 계층을 너무 많이 추가하는 예입니다.네임스페이스가 필요할때도 있지만 모듈을 사용할 때는 추가적인 레벨의 간접 참조를 추가합니다.이는 사용자에게 재빠르게 고통이 될 수 있으며 일반적으로 불필요합니다.  \nexport 클래스의 정적 메서드에도 비슷한 문제가 있습니다 - 클래스 자체적으로 중첩 계층을 추가합니다.표현이나 의도가 명확하고 유용한 방식으로 증가하지 않는 한 간단한 헬퍼 함수를 내보내는 것을 고려하세요.\n단일 class 또는 function만 export하는 경우 export default를 사용하세요 (If you're only exporting a single class or function, use export default)\n\"최상위 레벨에 가깝게 내보내기\"가 모듈 사용자의 마찰을 줄이는 것처럼 default export를 도입하는 것도 마찬가지입니다.모듈의 주요 목적이 하나의 특정 export를 저장하는 것이라면 이를 default export로 export 하는 것을 고려해야 합니다.이렇게 하면 importing를 사용하며 실제로 import를 더 쉽게 사용할 수 있습니다.\n예를 들면:\nMyClass.ts\nexport default class SomeType {\n  constructor() { ... }\n}\n\nMyFunc.ts\nexport default function getThing() { return \"thing\"; }\n\nConsumer.ts\nimport t from \"./MyClass\";\nimport f from \"./MyFunc\";\nlet x = new t();\nconsole.log(f());\n\n이는 사용자를 위한 최적의 선택입니다.타입의 이름을 원하는 대로 지을 수 있으며(이 경우 t) 객체를 찾기 위해 과도하게 점을 찍을 필요가 없습니다.\n다수의 객체를 내보내는 경우 모두 최상위 레벨에 배치하세요. (If you're exporting multiple objects, put them all at top-level)\nMyThings.ts\nexport class SomeType { /* ... */ }\nexport function someFunc() { /* ... */ }\n\n반대로 가져올 때:\nimported 이름을 명시적으로 나열 (Explicitly list imported names)\nConsumer.ts\nimport { SomeType, someFunc } from \"./MyThings\";\nlet x = new SomeType();\nlet y = someFunc();\n\n다수를 importing 하는 경우 네임스페이스 import 패턴 사용 (Use the namespace import pattern if you're importing a large number of things)\nMyLargeModule.ts\nexport class Dog { ... }\nexport class Cat { ... }\nexport class Tree { ... }\nexport class Flower { ... }\n\nConsumer.ts\nimport * as myLargeModule from \"./MyLargeModule.ts\";\nlet x = new myLargeModule.Dog();\n\n확장을 위한 다시 내보내기 (Re-export to extend)\n종종 모듈의 기능을 확장해야 합니다.일반적인 JS 패턴은 JQuery 확장이 작동하는 것과 비슷한 extensions을 사용하여 원본 객체를 보강하는 것입니다.앞서 언급했듯이 모듈은 전역 네임스페이스 객체처럼 병합되지 않습니다.권장되는 해결책은 원본 객체를 변형시키지 않고 새로운 기능을 제공하는 새로운 엔티티를 export하는  것입니다.\nCalculator.ts 모듈에 정의된 간단한 계산기 구현을 고려해보세요.또한 모듈은 입력 문자열 목록을

타입을 찾습니다.  \n타입을 계층적 네임스페이스로 구성하여 이러한 타입의 사용자에게 훌륭한 \"발견\" 경험을 제공합니다.반면 모듈은 필수적으로 파일 시스템에 이미 존재합니다.경로와 파일 이름으로 해결해야 하므로 사용할 수있는 논리적 조직 체계가 있습니다.목록 모듈이 포함된 /collections/generic/ 폴더를 사용할 수 있습니다.\n전역 스코프에서 충돌된 이름을 지정하지 않으려면 네임스페이스가 중요합니다.예를 들어  My.Application.Customer.AddForm과 My.Application.Order.AddForm 같은 이름이지만 다른 네임스페이스를 가진 두 가지 타입이 있을 수 있습니다.그러나 이것은 모듈과 관련된 문제는 아닙니다.모듈 내에서 동일한 이름을 가진 두 개의 객체를

간략하게 설명합니다.용어에 대해 언급할 때 \"내부(internal) 모듈\"은 이제 \"네임스페이스\"로 언급됩니다.또 내부 모듈을 선언할 때 module 키워드가 사용된 곳이라면 어디에서나 namespace 키워드를 대신 사용할 수 있습니다.비슷한 이름의 용어로 오버로드함으로써 새로운 사용자에게 주는 혼동을 방지합니다.\n첫 걸음 (First steps)\n먼저 이 페이지의 예제로 사용할 프로그램에서부터 시작해보겠습니다.웹 페이지의 양식에 대한 사용자 입력을 확인하거나 외부에서 제공하는 데이터 파일의 형식을 확인하기 위해 작성할 수 있는 간단한 문자열 유효성 검사기를 작성했습니다.\n단일 파일의 유효성 검사기 (Validators in a single file)\ninterface

객체와의 이름 충돌에 대해 걱정하지 않을 수 있는 일종의 조직 체계를 원할 것입니다.전역 네임스페이스에 다른 이름을 많이 추가하는 대신 객체를 네임스페이스로 마무리합시다.\n이 예제에서는 모든 validator 관련 엔티티를 Validation라는 네임스페이스로 이동합니다.여기서 인터페이스와 클래스를 네임스페이스 외부에서 볼 수 있기를 원하기 때문에 export를 머리말에 붙입니다.반대로 변수 lettersRegexp와 numberRegexp는 구현 세부 사항이므로 노출되지 않은 상태로 남아있어 네임스페이스 외부의 코드에는 보이지 않습니다.파일의 아래쪽에 있는 테스트 코드에서 (예: Validation.LettersOnlyValidator)와 같이 네임스페이스 외부에서 사용할 경우 타입의 이름을 확인해야 합니다.\nNamespaced Validators\nnamespace Validation {\n    export interface StringValidator {\n        isAcceptable(s: string): boolean;\n    }\n\n    const lettersRegexp = /^[A-Za-z]+$/;\n

여러 파일로 나누어 유지 보수하기 쉽게 만들려고 합니다.\nMulti-file namespaces\n여기서 Validation 네임스페이스를 많은 파일들로 나눌 것입니다.파일은 별개이지만 각각 동일한 네임스페이스에 기여할 수 있으며 모든 파일이 한곳에서 정의된 것처럼 사용할 수 있습니다.파일 간 의존성이 있기 때문에 컴파일러에게 파일들 간의 관계를 알려주는 참조 태그를 추가합니다.테스트 코드는 변경되지 않습니다.\nValidation.ts\nnamespace Validation {\n    export interface StringValidator {\n        isAcceptable(s: string): boolean;\n    }\n}\n\nLettersOnlyValidator.ts\n///

파일로 컴파일 할 수 있습니다:\ntsc --outFile sample.js Test.ts\n\n컴파일러는 파일에 있는 참조 태그를 기반으로 출력 파일을 자동으로 정렬합니다.각 파일을 개별적으로 지정할 수도 있습니다:\ntsc --outFile sample.js Validation.ts LettersOnlyValidator.ts ZipCodeValidator.ts Test.ts\n\n또는 파일별 컴파일(기본값)을 사용하여 각 입력 파일에 대한 JavaScript 파일을 하나씩 내보낼 수 있습니다.만약 여러 개의 JS 파일이 생성되면 웹 페이지에 있는 태그를 사용하여 출력된 각 파일을 적절한 순서대로 로드해야 합니다.\n예를 들면:\nMyTestPage.html (excerpt)\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n별칭 (Aliases)\n네임스페이스 작업을 단순화할 수 있는 또 다른 방법은 import x = require(\"name\")를 사용하여 일반적으로 사용되는 객체의 더 짧은 이름을 생성하는 것입니다.이러한 종류의 imports(별칭으로 불림)를 모듈 imports에서 생성된 객체를 포함한 모든 종류의 식별자에 사용할 수 있습니다.\nnamespace Shapes {\n    export namespace Polygons {\n        export class Triangle { }\n        export class Square { }\n    }\n}\n\nimport polygons = Shapes.Polygons;\nlet sq = new polygons.Square(); // 'new Shapes.Polygons.Square()'와 동일합니다\n\nrequire 키워드는 사용하지 않습니다. 대신 가져오는 심볼에 걸맞은 이름을 직접 할당합니다.이것은 var 사용과 비슷하지만 가져온 심볼의 타입과 네임스페이스 의미에 대해서도 작용합니다.중요한 점은, 값의 경우 import는 원래 심볼과 별개의 참조이므로 앨리어싱된 var에 대한 변경 사항은 원래 변수에 반영되지 않습니다.\n다른 JavaScript 라이브러리로 작업하기 (Working with Other JavaScript Libraries)\nTypeScript에서 작성되지 않은 라이브러리의 형태을 설명하려면 라이브러리에서 표시하는 API를 선언해야 합니다.대부분의 JavaScript 라이브러리는 몇 개의 최상위 레벨의 객체만 노출하므로 네임스페이스는 객체를 표현할 수있는 좋은 방법입니다.\n구현을 \"ambient\"으로 정의하지 않는 선언을 호출합니다.일반적으로 이들은 .d.ts 파일에 정의되어 있습니다.C/C++에 익숙하다면 .d.ts 파일로 생각할 수 있습니다.몇 가지 예를 살펴보겠습니다.\nAmbient Namespaces\n인기 있는 라이브러리 D3는 d3이라는 전역 객체에서 기능을 정의합니다.이 라이브러리는  태그 (모듈 로더 대신)를 통해 로드되기 때문에 선언에 네임스페이스를 사용하여 그 형태을 정의합니다.TypeScript 컴파일러가 이 형태을 보려면 ambient 네임스페이스 선언을 사용합니다.\n예를 들어 다음과 같이 작성할 수 있습니다:\nD3.d.ts (simplified excerpt)\ndeclare namespace D3 {\n    export interface Selectors {\n        select: {\n            (selector: string): Selection;\n            (element: EventTarget): Selection;\n        };\n    }\n\n    export interface Event {\n        x: number;\n        y: number;\n    }\n\n    export interface Base extends Selectors {\n        event: Event;\n

모듈을 사용하는 방법에 대한 몇 가지 고급 주제를 살펴보고 TypeScript에서 사용할 때 일반적인 몇 가지 함정을 다룰 예정입니다.\n모듈에 대한 자세한 내용은 모듈의 문서를 참조하세요.네임스페이스에 대한 자세한 내용은 네임스페이스의 문서를 참조하세요.\n네임스페이스 사용하기 (Using Namespaces)\n네임스페이스는 전역 네임스페이스에서 JavaScript 객체로 불립니다.네임스페이스를 매우 사용하기 간단한 구조로 만듭니다.여러 파일에 걸쳐있을 수 있으며 --outFile을 사용하여 연결될 수 있습니다.네임스페이스는 HTML 페이지에  태그로 포 된 모든 의존성을 가진 웹 애플리케이션에서 코드를 구조화하는 좋은 방법이 될 수 있습니다.\n모든 전역 네임스페이스 오염과 마찬가지로, 특히 대규모 애플리케이션에서는 구성 요소 의존성을 식별하기 어려울 수 있습니다.\n모듈 사용하기 (Using Modules)\n네임 스페이스와 마찬가지로 모듈에는 코드와 선언을 모두 포함시킵니다.가장 큰 차이점은 모듈이 의존성을 선언한다는 것입니다.\n모듈은 또한 모듈 로더에 대한 의존성을 가지고 있습니다 (예: CommonJs/Require.js)작은 JS 애플리케이션의 경우는 최적이 아닐 수도 있지만 대규모 애플리케이션의 경우 장기적인 모듈성 및 유지 관리에 이점이 있습니다.모듈은 더 나은 코드 재사용, 강력한 격리 및 번들링을 위한 향상된 도구 지원을 제공합니다.\n또한 Node.js 애플리케이션의 경우 모듈이 기본이며 코드를 구조화하기 위한 권장 방법임을 유의해야 합니다.\nECMAScript 2015 부터는 모듈은 언어의 기본 요소이며 모든 호환 엔진 구현에서 지원해야 합니다.따라서 새로운 프로젝트의 경우 모듈이 코드 구성 메커니즘의 권장 사항이 됩니다.\n네임스페이스와 모듈의 위험 (Pitfalls of Namespaces and Modules)\n이 섹션에서는 네임스페이스와 모듈을 사용할 때 흔히 발생하는 다양한 위험에 대해 설명하고 이를 피하는 방법에 대해 알아보겠습니다.\n/// -ing a module\n일반적인 실수는 import 문을 사용하는 대신 모듈 파일을 참조하기 위해 ///  문을 사용하는 것이다.차이점을 이해하기 위해서는, 우선 컴파일러가 import(예:'...'에서 '...',import x from \"...\";에서 import x = require(\"...\"); 경로를 기반으로 모듈에 대한 타입 정보를 찾는 방법을 먼저 이해할 필요가 있습니다.\n컴파일러는 적절한 경로로 .ts, .tsx 그리고.d.ts를 찾으려 할 겁니다.특정 파일을 찾을 수 없으면 컴파일러는 ambient 모듈 선언을 찾습니다.이 파일들을 .d.ts 파일에 선언해야 한다는 것을 기억해야 합니다.\n\nmyModules.d.ts\n// 모듈이 아닌 .d.ts 파일 또는 .ts 파일:\ndeclare module \"SomeModule\" {\n    export function fn(): string;\n}\n\n\nmyOtherModule.ts\n/// \nimport * as m from \"SomeModule\";\n\n\n\n여기서 참조 태그는 ambient 모듈에 대한 선언을 포함하는 선언 파일을 찾을 수 있게 해줍니다.이것은 다수의 TypeScript 샘플에서 사용되는 node.d.ts 파일이 사용되는 방법입니다.\n불필요한 네임스페이스 (Needless Namespacing)\n프로그램을 네임스페이스에서 모듈로 변환하는 경우에는 다음과 파일로 같은 쉽게 끝날 수 있습니다:\n\nshapes.ts\nexport namespace Shapes {\n    export class Triangle { /* ... */ }\n    export class Square { /* ... */ }\n}\n\n\n\n여기 최상위 모듈인 Shapes은 Triangle과 Square를 감싸고 있는 데 아무런 이유가 없습니다.이는 모듈의 사용자들을 혼란스럽고 성가시게 합니다:\n\nshapeConsumer.ts\nimport * as shapes from \"./shapes\";\nlet t = new shapes.Shapes.Triangle(); // shapes.Shapes?\n\n\n\nTypeScript에서 모듈의 주요 특징은 두 개의 서로 다른 모듈이 동일한 스코프에 이름을 제공하지 않는다는 것입니다.모듈의 사용자가 할당할 이름을 결정하기 때문에 네임스페이스에서 내보낸 심볼을 사전에 감쌀 필요가 없습니다.\n모듈 내용의 네임스페이스를 지정하지 않아야 하는 이유를 반복해서 설명하기 위해 Namespacing은 구조의 논리적 그룹을 제공하고 이름 충돌을 방지하는 것입니다.모듈 파일 자체는 논리적 그룹이며 최상위 이름은 이를 가져오는 코드에 의해 정의되기 때문에 내보낸 객체에 대해 추가적인 모듈 계층을 사용할 필요가 없습니다.\n다음은 수정된 예입니다.\n\nshapes.ts\nexport class Triangle { /* ... */ }\nexport class Square { /* ... */ }\n\n\nshapeConsumer.ts\nimport * as shapes from \"./shapes\";\nlet t = new shapes.Triangle();\n\n\n\n모듈의 관계 (Trade-offs of Modules)\nJS 파일과 모듈 사이에 일대일 대응이 있는 것과 마찬가지로 TypeScript는 모듈 소스 파일과 발생된 JS 파일 간에 일대일 대응을 합니다.이에 따른 한가지 효과는 대상 모듈 시스템에 따라 여러 모듈 소스 파일을 연결할 수 없다는 것입니다.예를 들어 commonjs 또는 umd를 대상으로 하는 동안 outFile 옵션을 사용할 수 없지만 TypeScript 1.8 이상에서는 amd 또는 system을 대상으로 지정할 때 outFile을 사용할 수 있습니다.\n"},"pages/Module

사용하는 프로세스입니다.import { a } from \"moduleA\"와 같은 import 문을 고려하세요.  \na의 사용을 검사하기 위해서는 컴파일러는 그것이 무엇을 의미하는지 정확히 알아야 하며 그것의 정의인 moduleA를 검사해야 할 필요가 있습니다.\n이때 컴파일러가 \"moduleA의 형태가 무엇입니까?\"라고 묻습니다.이것은 간단하게 들릴지 모르지만 moduleA는 자신의 .ts/.tsx 파일들 중 하나 또는 사용자의 코드가 의존하는 .d.ts 파일 중 하나에서 정의될 수 있습니다.\n먼저 컴파일러는 가져온 모듈을 나타내는 파일을 찾습니다.이렇게하기 위해 컴파일러는 다음 두 가지 전략 중 하나를 따릅니다: 클래식 또는 노드.이 전략은 컴파일러에게 moduleA를 찾을 위치를 알려줍니다.\n그래도 작동하지 않고 모듈 이름이 관련이 없는 경우(\"moduleA\"의 경우에는)  컴파일러는 ambient module declaration을 찾으려고 시도할 것입니다.다음에 Non-relative imports에 대해 다룰 것입니다.\n마지막으로 컴파일러가 모듈을 해석하지 못하면 오류를 기록합니다.이 경우 오류는 오류 TS2307 : 모듈 'moduleA'을 찾을 수 없습니다.\n상대적 vs. 비-상대적 모듈 import (Relative vs. Non-relative module imports)\n모듈 imports는 모듈 참조가 상대적인지 아닌지에 따라 다르게 처리됩니다.\nrelative import는 /, ./ 또는 ../ 로 시작하는 임포트입니다.몇 가지 예는 다음과 같습니다:\n\nimport Entry from \"./components/Entry\";\nimport { DefaultHeaders } from \"../constants/http\";\nimport \"/mod\";\n\n다른 모든 import는 non-relative로 간주됩니다.몇 가지 예는 다음과 같습니다:\n\nimport * as $ from \"jquery\";\nimport { Component } from \"@angular/core\";\n\nimport된 파일과 관련하여 relative import가 해석되었으며 ambient module declaration에 으로 해석할 수는 없습니다.상대적인 위치를 런타임에 유지할 수 있도록 보장되는 모듈에 relative imports를 사용해야 합니다.\nnon-relative import는 baseUrl을 기준 또는 경로 매핑을 통해 해석될 수 있습니다.또한 ambient module declarations으로 해석할 수도 있습니다.외부의 의존성을 가져올 때는 non-relative 경로를 사용하세요.\n모듈 해석 전략 (Module Resolution Strategies)\n모듈 해석 전략에는 두가지가 있습니다: 노드와 클래식.--moduleResolution를 사용하여 모듈 해석 전략을 지정할 수 있습니다.지정하지 않은 경우 기본값은 --module AMD | System | ES2015인 경우 클래식이며 그렇지 않다면 노드입니다.\n클래식 (Classic)\n이것은 TypeScript의 기본 해석 전략이었습니다.요즘은 주로 이전 버전과의 호환성을 위해 이 전략이 존재합니다.\nrelative import는 import된 파일과 관련하여 해석됩니다.그러므로 소스 파일 /root/src/folder/A.ts에 있는 import { b } from \"./moduleB\"를 실행하면 다음과 같은 결과가 나옵니다:\n\n/root/src/folder/moduleB.ts\n/root/src/folder/moduleB.d.ts\n\n그러나 non-relative 모듈 imports의 경우 컴파일러는 imports 파일이 포함된 디렉토리부터 시작하여 일치하는 정의 파일을 가져오기 위해 디렉토리 트리를 찾으려합니다.\n예를 들면:\nmoduleB를 소스 파일에서 import { b } from \"moduleB\"와 같이 상대적으로 가져오지 않으면 \"moduleB\"를 찾기 위해 다음과 같은 위치에서 찾게 됩니다:\n\n/root/src/folder/moduleB.ts\n/root/src/folder/moduleB.d.ts\n/root/src/moduleB.ts\n/root/src/moduleB.d.ts\n/root/moduleB.ts\n/root/moduleB.d.ts\n/moduleB.ts\n/moduleB.d.ts\n\n노드 (Node)\n이 해석 전략은 런타임에 Node.js 모듈 분석 메커니즘을 모방하려고 시도합니다.전체 Node.js 해석 알고리즘은 Node.js 모듈 문서에 설명되어 있습니다.\nNode.js 모듈 해석 방법 (How Node.js resolves modules)\nTS 컴파일러가 따르는 단계를 이해하려면 Node.js 모듈에 대해 설명하는 것이 중요합니다.전통적으로, Node.js의 import는 require라는 함수를 호출함으로써 수행됩니다.Node.js가 취하는 동작은 require에 상대 경로인지 비-상대 경로인지에 따라 달라집니다.\n상대 경로는 매우 간단합니다.예를 들어 var x = require(\"./moduleB\"); import가 포함된 /root/src/moduleA.js에 있는 파일을 살펴보겠습니다.Node.js는 가져 오기를 다음 순서로 해석합니다:\n\n/root/src/moduleB.js라는 이름의 파일이 존재합니다.\n\n\"main\" 모듈을 지정하는 package.json 파일이 포함된 경우 /root/src/moduleB 폴더로 지정합니다.이 예에서, Node.js가 { \"main\": \"lib/mainModule.js\" }를 포함하는 /root/src/moduleB/package.json 파일을 찾으면 Node.js는 /root/src/moduleB/lib/mainModule.js를 참조합니다.\n\nindex.js라는 파일이 포함되어 있다면 /root/src/moduleB 폴더로 간주합니다.그 파일은 암시적으로 그 폴더의 \"메인\" 모듈로 여겨집니다.\n\n\n이에 대한 자세한 내용은 파일 모듈과 폴더 모듈에 대한 Node.js 문서를 참조하세요.\n그러나 non-relative module name의 해석은 다르게 수행됩니다.node는 node_modules라는 특수 폴더에서 모듈을 검색합니다.node_modules 폴더는 현재 파일과 동일한 레벨이거나 디렉토리 체인에서 상위 레벨 일 수 있습니다.node는 불러오기 위한 모듈을 찾을 때까지 각 node_modules를 보고 디렉토리 체인을 거슬러 올라갑니다.\n위의 예제를 따르면, /root/src/moduleA.js가 비-상대 경로를 대신 사용하여 var x = require(\"moduleB\"); import를 가지고 있는지 고려해보세요.\n그런 다음 Node는 moduleB가 작동할 때까지 각 위치에 대해 해석을 시도합니다.\n\n/root/src/node_modules/moduleB.js\n/root/src/node_modules/moduleB/package.json (\"main\" 프로퍼티 지정)\n/root/src/node_modules/moduleB/index.js\n\n/root/node_modules/moduleB.js\n/root/node_modules/moduleB/package.json (\"main\" 프로퍼티

프로세스에 대한 자세한 내용은 node_modules에서 모듈을 로드하는 방법에 대한 node.js 문서를 참조하세요.\nTypeScript 모듈 해석 방법 (How TypeScript resolves modules)\nTypeScript는 컴파일 타임에 모듈에 대한 정의 파일을 찾기 위해 Node.js 런타임 해석 전략을 모방합니다.이를 달성하기 위해 TypeScript는 TypeScript 원본 파일 확장자 (.ts, .tsx, 및 .d.ts)을 노드의 해석 로직 위에 덮어씌웁니다.TypeScript는 또한 \"main\"의 목적을 반영하기 위해 package.json에 있는 `types\" 필드를 사용합니다 - 컴파일러가 이를 사용하여 참조할 \"main\" 정의 파일을 찾습니다.\n예를 들어 /root/src/moduleA.ts에서 import { b } from \"./moduleB\"와 같은 import 문은 \"./moduleB\"를 찾기 위해 다음 위치에서 시도하게됩니다:\n\n/root/src/moduleB.ts\n/root/src/moduleB.tsx\n/root/src/moduleB.d.ts\n/root/src/moduleB/package.json (\"types\" 프로퍼티 지정)\n/root/src/moduleB/index.ts\n/root/src/moduleB/index.tsx\n/root/src/moduleB/index.d.ts\n\nNode.js는 moduleB.js 파일을 찾은 다음, 적용 가능한 package.json 파일을 찾아 index.js 파일을 찾습니다.\n마찬가지로 비-상대적인 import에서는 Node.js 해석 로직을 따르고 먼저 파일을 검색한 다음 적용 가능한 폴더를 찾습니다.따라서 소스 파일 /root/src/moduleA.ts에서  import { b } from \"moduleB\"는 다음과 같은 조회를 하게 됩니다:\n\n/root/src/node_modules/moduleB.ts\n/root/src/node_modules/moduleB.tsx\n/root/src/node_modules/moduleB.d.ts\n/root/src/node_modules/moduleB/package.json (\"types\" 프로퍼티

(\"types\" 프로퍼티

(\"types\" 프로퍼티 지정)\n/node_modules/moduleB/index.ts\n/node_modules/moduleB/index.tsx\n/node_modules/moduleB/index.d.ts\n\n단계의 수에 겁먹지마세요 - TypeScript는 여전히 단계 (8)과 (15)에서 디렉토리를 두 번 점프합니다.이것은 정말로 Node.js보다 복잡하지 않습니다.\n추가적인 모듈 해석 알리기 (Additional module resolution flags)\n프로젝트 소스 레이아웃이 출력 결과와 일치하지 않는 경우가 있습니다.일반적으로 일련의 빌드 단계의 집합에서 최종 출력을 생성합니다.여기에는 .ts 파일을 .js로 컴파일하는 것과 다른 소스 위치의 의존성을 하나의 출력 위치에 복사하는 것이 포함됩니다.최종적으로 런타임에 모듈의 이름이 정의를 포함하는 소스 파일과 다를 수 있다는 것입니다.또는 최종 출력의 모듈 경로가 컴파일 시 해당 소스 파일 경로와 일치하지 않을 수 있습니다.\nTypeScript 컴파일러에는 최종 출력을 생성하기 위해 소스에 발생할 것으로 예상되는 변환의 컴파일러에 정보를 제공하기 위한 추가적인 것들이 있습니다.\n컴파일러가 이러한 변환을 하지 않을 것을 주목하는 것이 중요합니다.이 정보를 사용하여 모듈 import를 정의 파일로 해석하는 프로세스를 안내합니다.\nBase URL\nbaseUrl을 사용하는 것은 모듈이 런타임에 단일 폴더로 \"배포\"되는 AMD 모듈 로더를 사용하는 어플리케이션에서의 일반적인 방법입니다.이러한 모듈의 소스는 서로 다른 디렉토리에 존재할 수 있지만 빌드 스크립트에 의해 모두 결합되어 구성됩니다. \nbaseUrl을 설정하면 컴파일러에게 어디에서 모듈을 찾을 수 있는지 알려줍니다.비-상대적 이름을 가진 모든 모듈 imports는 baseUrl에 상대적인 것으로 가정됩니다.\nbaseUrl 값은 다음 중 하나로 결정됩니다:\n\nbaseUrl 커멘드 라인 인수의 값 (주어진 경로가 상대 경로인 경우 현재의 디렉토리의 위치를 기반으로 계산)\n'tsconfig.json'의 baseUrl 프로퍼티 값 (주어진 경로가 상대 경로인 경우 'tsconfig.json'의 위치를 기반으로 계산)\n\n상대적 모듈 imports는 baseUrl을 설정하면 영향을 받지 않으며 imports 파일과 관련하여 항상 확인되므로 주의해야합니다.\nRequireJS 및 SystemJS 문서에서 baseUrl에 대한 자세한 설명을 볼 수 있습니다.\n경로 매핑 (Path mapping)\n때때로 모듈은 baseUrl 아래에 직접 위치하지 않습니다.예를 들어, 모듈 \"jquery\"에 대한 import는 런타임시에 \"node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.slim.min.js\"로 변환됩니다.로더는 매핑 구성을 사용하여 런타임에 모듈 이름을 파일에 매핑 합니다. 자세한 내용은 RequireJs 문서와 SystemJS 문서를 참조하세요.  \nTypeScript 컴파일러는 tsconfig.json파일에서 \"paths\" 프로퍼티를  사용하여 이러한 매핑을 선언하는 기능을 지원합니다.다음은 jquery에 대한 \"paths\" 프로퍼티를 지정하는 예제입니다.\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\", // \"paths\"가 지정된 경우 이 값을 지정해야합니다.\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"jquery\": [\"node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery\"] // 이 매핑은 \"baseUrl\"과 상대적입니다.\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\"paths\"는 \"baseUrl\"에 비례해서 해석된다는 것을 주의하십시오.\"baseUrl\"을 \".\"보다 다른 값으로 설정할 때 즉 tsconfig.json의 디렉토리일때마다 매핑을 적절하게 변경해야합니다.가령 위의 예제에서 \"baseUrl\": \"./src\"를 설정하면 jquery는 \"../node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery\"에 매핑되어야합니다.\n\"paths\"를 사용하면 여러개의 fall back 위치를 포함한 좀 더 정교한 매핑을 사용할 수도 있습니다.한 위치에서는 일부 모듈만 사용할 수 있고 나머지는 다른 위치에 있는 프로젝트 구성을 고려해보세요.빌드 단계는 모든 것을 한 곳에 한 곳에 모일 것입니다.  \n프로젝트 레이아웃은 다음과 같을 수 있습니다:\nprojectRoot\n├── folder1\n│   ├── file1.ts (imports 'folder1/file2' and 'folder2/file3')\n│   └── file2.ts\n├── generated\n│   ├── folder1\n│   └── folder2\n│       └── file3.ts\n└── tsconfig.json\n\n해당 tsconfig.json은 다음과 같습니다:\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"*\": [\n        \"*\",\n        \"generated/*\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n이것은 \"*\"(모든 값) 패턴과 일치하는 모듈 import를 컴파일러에게 알려줌으로써 두 위치를 살펴봅니다:\n\n\"*\": 변경되지 않은 동일한 이름을 의미하기때문에  => /을 매핑하세요.\n\"generated/*\" 추가된 접두어 \"generated\"가 붙은 모듈 이름을 의미하기때문에  => /generated/을 매핑하세요.\n\n이 로직에 따라 컴파일러는 두 가지 imports를 다음과 같이 해석하기위해 노력합니다:\n\nimport 'folder1/file2'\n'*' 패턴이 일치하고 와일드 카드가 전체 모듈 이름을 캡처합니다.\n먼저 목록에 대체를 시도하세요: '*' -> folder1/file2\n이에 따른 대체 결과는 비상대적인 이름입니다 - baseUrl 와 결합하세요 -> projectRoot/folder1/file2.ts.\n좋아요. 파일이 존재합니다.\n\n\nimport 'folder2/file3'\n'*' 패턴이 일치하고 와일드 카드가 전체 모듈 이름을 캡처합니다.\n먼저 목록에 대체를 시도하세요: '*' -> folder2/file3\n이에 따른 대체 결과는 비-상대적인 이름입니다 - baseUrl 와 결합하세요 -> projectRoot/folder2/file3.ts.\n파일이 존재하지 않습니다. 두번째 대체 파일로 이동하세요.\n두번째 대체 'generated/*' -> generated/folder2/file3\n이에 따른 대체 결과는 비-상대적인 이름입니다 - baseUrl 와 결합하세요 -> projectRoot/generated/folder2/file3.ts.\n좋아요. 파일이 존재합니다.\n\n\n\nrootDirs 디렉토리 (Virtual Directories with rootDirs)\n컴파일 시 여러 디렉토리의 프로젝트 소스가 모두 결합되어 단일 출력 디렉토리를 생성하는 경우가 있습니다.이것은 소스 디렉토리가 \"가상\" 디렉토리를 만드는 것으로 볼 수 있습니다.\nrootDirs를 사용하면 \"가상\" 디렉토리를 구성하는 roots를 컴파일러에 알릴 수 있습니다.따라서 컴파일러는 이러한 \"가상\" 디렉토리내의 상대 모듈 imports를 하나의 디렉토리에 병합된 것처럼 해석 할 수 있습니다.\n예를 들어 다음 프로젝트 구조를 고려해보세요.\n src\n └── views\n     └── view1.ts (imports './template1')\n     └── view2.ts\n\n generated\n └── templates\n         └── views\n             └── template1.ts (imports './view2')\n\nsrc/views의 파일은 일부 UI컨트롤의 사용자 코드입니다.generated/templates 파일은 빌드의 일부로 템플릿 생성기에 의해 자동 생성된 UI템플릿 바인딩 코드입니다.빌드 단계는 /src/views 및 /generated/templates/views에 있는 파일을 출력의 동일한 디렉토리에 복사합니다.런타임에 뷰는 템플릿이 그 옆에 존재하기를 기대할 수 있으므로 상대적 이름을 \"./template\"로 사용하여 import합니다.\n이 관계를 컴파일러에 지정하려면 \"rootDirs\"를 사용하세요.\"rootDirs\"은 내용이 런타임에 병합될 것으로 예상되는 roots 목록을 지정합니다.따라서 우리의 예에 따라, tsconfig.json파일은 다음과 같이 보여야 합니다:\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"rootDirs\": [\n      \"src/views\",\n      \"generated/templates/views\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n컴파일러가 rootDirs의 하위 폴더에 있는 상대적 모듈 가져오기를 볼 때마다 rootDirs의 각 항목에서 import를 검색합니다.\nrootDirs의 유연성은 논리적으로 병합된 물리적 소스 디렉토리 목록 지정에 한정되는 것은 아닙니다.제공된 배열은 존재 여부에 관계 없이 원하는 수의 임의 디렉토리 이름을 포함할 수 있습니다.이를 통해 컴파일러는 조건부 포함 및 프로젝트 별 로더 플러그인과 같은 정교한 번들 및 런타임 기능을 타입 세이프 방식으로 캡처할 수 있습니다.\n빌드 도구가 ./#{locale}/messages와 같은 상대 모듈 경로의 일부로써 특별한 경로 토큰 #{locale}을 삽입하여 지역 특정 번들을 자동으로 생성하는 국제화 시나리오를 생각해보세요.  \n이 가상 설정에서 도구는 지원되는 로케일을 열거하고 추상화된 경로를 ./zh/messages, ./de/messages 등으로 매핑합니다.  \n이러한 각 모듈이 일련의 문자열을 내보낸다고 가정합니다.예를 들어 ./zh/messages에는 다음이 포함될 수 있습니다:\nexport default [\n    \"您好吗\",\n    \"很高兴认识你\"\n];\n\nrootDirs를 활용하여 디렉토리가 존재하지 않더라도 이 매핑의 컴파일러에 이를 알려 줌으로써 ./#{locale}/messages를 안전하게 해결할 수 있습니다.\n예를 들어, 다음과 같은 tsconfig.json을 함께 사용합니다:\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"rootDirs\": [\n      \"src/zh\",\n      \"src/de\",\n      \"src/#{locale}\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n이제 컴파일러는 import messages from './#{locale}/messages'에서 import messages from './zh/messages'의 메시지를 가져 와서 시간 지원 계획을 해치지 않고 지역에 상관없이 개발할 수 있습니다.\n모듈 해석 추적 (Tracing module resolution)\n앞에서 설명한 것처럼 컴파일러가 모듈을 해석할 때 현재 폴더 외부의 파일들에 방문할 수 있습니다.모듈이 해석되지 않은 이유를 진단하거나 잘못된 정의로 해석된 경우에는  문제 해석이 어려울 수 있습니다.--traceResolution을 사용하여 컴파일러 모듈 해석 추적을 활성화하면 모듈 확인 프로세스 중에 발생한 일에 대한 통찰력을 얻을 수 있습니다.\ntypescript 모듈을 사용하는 샘플 애플리케이션이 있다고 가정해 봅시다.app.ts는 import * as ts from \"typescript\"와 같은 import를 가지고 있습니다.\n│   tsconfig.json\n├───node_modules\n│   └───typescript\n│       └───lib\n│

This means that after merging, merged members that came from other declarations cannot see non-exported members.\nWe can see this more clearly in this example:\nnamespace Animal {\n    let haveMuscles = true;\n\n    export function animalsHaveMuscles() {\n        return haveMuscles;\n    }\n}\n\nnamespace Animal {\n    export function doAnimalsHaveMuscles() {\n        return haveMuscles;  // \nBecause haveMuscles is not exported, only the animalsHaveMuscles function that shares the same un-merged namespace can see the symbol.\nThe doAnimalsHaveMuscles function, even though it's part of the merged Animal namespace can not see this un-exported member.\nMerging Namespaces with Classes, Functions, and Enums\nNamespaces are flexible enough to also merge with other types of declarations.\nTo do so, the namespace declaration must follow the declaration it will merge with. The resulting declaration has properties of both declaration types.\nTypeScript uses this capability to model some of the patterns in JavaScript as well as other programming languages.\nMerging Namespaces with Classes\nThis gives the user a way of describing inner classes.\nclass Album {\n    label: Album.AlbumLabel;\n}\nnamespace Album {\n    export class AlbumLabel { }\n}\n\nThe visibility rules for merged members is the same as described in the 'Merging Namespaces' section, so we must export the AlbumLabel class for the merged class to see it.\nThe end result is a class managed inside of another class.\nYou can also use namespaces to add more static members to an existing class.\nIn addition to the pattern of inner classes, you may also be familiar with JavaScript practice of creating a function and then extending the function further by adding properties onto the function.\nTypeScript uses declaration merging to build up definitions like this in a type-safe way.\nfunction buildLabel(name: string): string {\n    return buildLabel.prefix + name + buildLabel.suffix;\n}\n\nnamespace buildLabel {\n    export let suffix = \"\";\n    export let prefix = \"Hello, \";\n}\n\nalert(buildLabel(\"Sam Smith\"));\n\nSimilarly, namespaces can be used to extend enums with static members:\nenum Color {\n    red = 1,\n    green = 2,\n    blue = 4\n}\n\nnamespace Color {\n    export function mixColor(colorName: string) {\n        if (colorName == \"yellow\") {\n            return Color.red + Color.green;\n        }\n        else if (colorName == \"white\") {\n            return Color.red + Color.green + Color.blue;\n        }\n        else if (colorName == \"magenta\") {\n            return Color.red + Color.blue;\n        }\n        else if (colorName == \"cyan\") {\n            return Color.green + Color.blue;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nDisallowed Merges\nNot all merges are allowed in TypeScript.\nCurrently, classes can not merge with other classes or with variables.\nFor information on mimicking class merging, see the Mixins in TypeScript section.\nModule Augmentation\nAlthough JavaScript modules do not support merging, you can patch existing objects by importing and then updating them.\nLet's look at a toy Observable example:\n// observable.js\nexport class Observable {\n    // ... implementation left as an exercise for the reader ...\n}\n\n// map.js\nimport { Observable } from \"./observable\";\nObservable.prototype.map = function (f) {\n    // ... another exercise for the reader\n}\n\nThis works fine in TypeScript too, but the compiler doesn't know about Observable.prototype.map.\nYou can use module augmentation to tell the compiler about it:\n// observable.ts stays the same\n// map.ts\nimport { Observable } from \"./observable\";\ndeclare module \"./observable\" {\n    interface Observable {\n        map(f: (x: T) => U): Observable;\n    }\n}\nObservable.prototype.map = function (f) {\n    // ... another exercise for the reader\n}\n\n\n// consumer.ts\nimport { Observable } from \"./observable\";\nimport \"./map\";\nlet o: Observable;\no.map(x => x.toFixed());\n\nThe module name is resolved the same way as module specifiers in import/export.\nSee Modules for more information.\nThen the declarations in an augmentation are merged as if they were declared in the same file as the original.\nHowever, you can't declare new top-level declarations in the augmentation -- just patches to existing declarations.\nGlobal augmentation\nYou can also add declarations to the global scope from inside a module:\n// observable.ts\nexport class Observable {\n    // ... still no implementation ...\n}\n\ndeclare global {\n    interface Array {\n        toObservable(): Observable;\n    }\n}\n\nArray.prototype.toObservable = function () {\n    // ...\n}\n\nGlobal augmentations have the same behavior and limits as module augmentations.\n"},"pages/JSX.html":{"url":"pages/JSX.html","title":"JSX","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nJSX is an embeddable XML-like syntax.\nIt is meant to be transformed into valid JavaScript, though the semantics of that transformation are implementation-specific.\nJSX came to popularity with the React framework, but has since seen other applications as well.\nTypeScript supports embedding, type checking, and compiling JSX directly into JavaScript.\nBasic usage\nIn order to use JSX you must do two things.\n\nName your files with a .tsx extension\nEnable the jsx option\n\nTypeScript ships with three JSX modes: preserve, react, and react-native.\nThese modes only affect the emit stage - type checking is unaffected.\nThe preserve mode will keep the JSX as part of the output to be further consumed by another transform step (e.g. Babel).\nAdditionally the output will have a .jsx file extension.\nThe react mode will emit React.createElement, does not need to go through a JSX transformation before use, and the output will have a .js file extension.\nThe react-native mode is the equivalent of preserve in that it keeps all JSX, but the output will instead have a .js file extension.\n\n\n\nMode\nInput\nOutput\nOutput File Extension\n\n\n\n\npreserve\n\n\n.jsx\n\n\nreact\n\nReact.createElement(\"div\")\n.js\n\n\nreact-native\n\n\n.js\n\n\n\nYou can specify this mode using either the --jsx command line flag or the corresponding option in your tsconfig.json file.\n\nNote: The identifier React is hard-coded, so you must make React available with an uppercase R.\n\nThe as operator\nRecall how to write a type assertion:\nvar foo = bar;\n\nHere we are asserting the variable bar to have the type foo.\nSince TypeScript also uses angle brackets for type assertions, JSX's syntax introduces certain parsing difficulties. As a result, TypeScript disallows angle bracket type assertions in .tsx files.\nTo make up for this loss of functionality in .tsx files, a new type assertion operator has been added: as.\nThe above example can easily be rewritten with the as operator.\nvar foo = bar as foo;\n\nThe as operator is available in both .ts and .tsx files, and is identical in behavior to the other type assertion style.\nType Checking\nIn order to understand type checking with JSX, you must first understand the difference between intrinsic elements and value-based elements.\nGiven a JSX expression , expr may either refer to something intrinsic to the environment (e.g. a div or span in a DOM environment) or to a custom component that you've created.\nThis is important for two reasons:\n\nFor React, intrinsic elements are emitted as strings (React.createElement(\"div\")), whereas a component you've created is not (React.createElement(MyComponent)).\nThe types of the attributes being passed in the JSX element should be looked up differently.\nIntrinsic element attributes should be known intrinsically whereas components will likely want to specify their own set of attributes.\n\nTypeScript uses the same convention that React does for distinguishing between these.\nAn intrinsic element always begins with a lowercase letter, and a value-based element always begins with an uppercase letter.\nIntrinsic elements\nIntrinsic elements are looked up on the special interface JSX.IntrinsicElements.\nBy default, if this interface is not specified, then anything goes and intrinsic elements will not be type checked.\nHowever, if this interface is present, then the name of the intrinsic element is looked up as a property on the JSX.IntrinsicElements interface.\nFor example:\ndeclare namespace JSX {\n    interface IntrinsicElements {\n        foo: any\n    }\n}\n\n; // ok\n; // error\n\nIn the above example,  will work fine but  will result in an error since it has not been specified on JSX.IntrinsicElements.\n\nNote: You can also specify a catch-all string indexer on JSX.IntrinsicElements as follows:\ndeclare namespace JSX {\n   interface IntrinsicElements {\n       [elemName: string]: any;\n   }\n}\n\n\nValue-based elements\nValue based elements are simply looked up by identifiers that are in scope.\nimport MyComponent from \"./myComponent\";\n\n; // ok\n; // error\n\nThere are two ways to define a value-based element:\n\nStateless Functional Component (SFC)\nClass Component\n\nBecause these two types of value-based elements are indistinguishable from each other in JSX expression, we first try to resolve the expression as Stateless Functional Component using overload resolution. If the process successes, then we are done resolving the expression to its declaration. If we fail to resolve as SFC, we will then try to resolve as a class component. If that fails, we will report an error.\nStateless Functional Component\nAs the name suggested, the component is defined as JavaScript function where its first argument is a props object.\nWe enforce that its return type must be assignable to JSX.Element\ninterface FooProp {\n  name: string;\n  X: number;\n  Y: number;\n}\n\ndeclare function AnotherComponent(prop: {name: string});\nfunction ComponentFoo(prop: FooProp) {\n  return ;\n}\n\nconst Button = (prop: {value: string}, context: { color: string }) => \n\nBecause SFC is simply a JavaScript function, we can utilize function overload here as well.\ninterface ClickableProps {\n  children: JSX.Element[] | JSX.Element\n}\n\ninterface HomeProps extends ClickableProps {\n  home: JSX.Element;\n}\n\ninterface SideProps extends ClickableProps {\n  side: JSX.Element | string;\n}\n\nfunction MainButton(prop: HomeProps): JSX.Element;\nfunction MainButton(prop: SideProps): JSX.Element {\n  ...\n}\n\nClass Component\nIt is possible to limit the type of a class component.\nHowever, for this we must introduce two new terms: the element class type and the element instance type.\nGiven , the element class type is the type of Expr.\nSo in the example above, if MyComponent was an ES6 class the class type would be that class.\nIf MyComponent was a factory function, the class type would be that function.\nOnce the class type is established, the instance type is determined by the union of the return types of the class type's call signatures and construct signatures.\nSo again, in the case of an ES6 class, the instance type would be the type of an instance of that class, and in the case of a factory function, it would be the type of the value returned from the function.\nclass MyComponent {\n  render() {}\n}\n\n// use a construct signature\nvar myComponent = new MyComponent();\n\n// element class type => MyComponent\n// element instance type => { render: () => void }\n\nfunction MyFactoryFunction() {\n  return {\n    render: () => {\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// use a call signature\nvar myComponent = MyFactoryFunction();\n\n// element class type => FactoryFunction\n// element instance type => { render: () => void }\n\nThe element instance type is interesting because it must be assignable to JSX.ElementClass or it will result in an error.\nBy default JSX.ElementClass is {}, but it can be augmented to limit the use of JSX to only those types that conform to the proper interface.\ndeclare namespace JSX {\n  interface ElementClass {\n    render: any;\n  }\n}\n\nclass MyComponent {\n  render() {}\n}\nfunction MyFactoryFunction() {\n  return { render: () => {} }\n}\n\n; // ok\n; // ok\n\nclass NotAValidComponent {}\nfunction NotAValidFactoryFunction() {\n  return {};\n}\n\n; // error\n; // error\n\nAttribute type checking\nThe first step to type checking attributes is to determine the element attributes type.\nThis is slightly different between intrinsic and value-based elements.\nFor intrinsic elements, it is the type of the property on JSX.IntrinsicElements\ndeclare namespace JSX {\n  interface IntrinsicElements {\n    foo: { bar?: boolean }\n  }\n}\n\n// element attributes type for 'foo' is '{bar?: boolean}'\n;\n\nFor value-based elements, it is a bit more complex.\nIt is determined by the type of a property on the element instance type that was previously determined.\nWhich property to use is determined by JSX.ElementAttributesProperty.\nIt should be declared with a single property.\nThe name of that property is then used.\ndeclare namespace JSX {\n  interface ElementAttributesProperty {\n    props; // specify the property name to use\n  }\n}\n\nclass MyComponent {\n  // specify the property on the element instance type\n  props: {\n    foo?: string;\n  }\n}\n\n// element attributes type for 'MyComponent' is '{foo?: string}'\n\n\nThe element attribute type is used to type check the attributes in the JSX.\nOptional and required properties are supported.\ndeclare namespace JSX {\n  interface IntrinsicElements {\n    foo: { requiredProp: string; optionalProp?: number }\n  }\n}\n\n; // ok\n; // ok\n; // error, requiredProp is missing\n; // error, requiredProp should be a string\n; // error, unknownProp does not exist\n; // ok, because 'some-unknown-prop' is not a valid identifier\n\n\nNote: If an attribute name is not a valid JS identifier (like a data-* attribute), it is not considered to be an error if it is not found in the element attributes type.\n\nThe spread operator also works:\nvar props = { requiredProp: \"bar\" };\n; // ok\n\nvar badProps = {};\n; // error\n\nChildren Type Checking\nIn 2.3, we introduce type checking of children. children is a property in an element attributes type which we have determined from type checking attributes.\nSimilar to how we use JSX.ElementAttributesProperty to determine the name of props, we use JSX.ElementChildrenAttribute to determine the name of children.\nJSX.ElementChildrenAttribute should be declared with a single property.\ndeclare namespace JSX {\n  interface ElementChildrenAttribute {\n    children: {};  // specify children name to use\n  }\n}\n\nWithout explicitly specify type of children, we will use default type from React typings.\n\n  Hello\n;\n\n\n  Hello\n  World\n;\n\nconst CustomComp = (props) => props.children\n\n  Hello World\n  {\"This is just a JS expression...\" + 1000}\n\n\nYou can specify type of children like any other attribute. This will overwritten default type from React typings.\ninterface PropsType {\n  children: JSX.Element\n  name: string\n}\n\nclass Component extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        this.props.children\n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n\n// OK\n\n  Hello World\n\n\n// Error: children is of type JSX.Element not array of JSX.Element\n\n  Hello World\n  Hello World\n\n\n// Error: children is of type JSX.Element not array of JSX.Element or string.\n\n  Hello\n  World\n\n\nThe JSX result type\nBy default the result of a JSX expression is typed as any.\nYou can customize the type by specifying the JSX.Element interface.\nHowever, it is not possible to retrieve type information about the element, attributes or children of the JSX from this interface.\nIt is a black box.\nEmbedding Expressions\nJSX allows you to embed expressions between tags by surrounding the expressions with curly braces ({ }).\nvar a = \n  {[\"foo\", \"bar\"].map(i => {i / 2})}\n\n\nThe above code will result in an error since you cannot divide a string by a number.\nThe output, when using the preserve option, looks like:\nvar a = \n  {[\"foo\", \"bar\"].map(function (i) { return {i / 2}; })}\n\n\nReact integration\nTo use JSX with React you should use the React typings.\nThese typings define the JSX namespace appropriately for use with React.\n/// \n\ninterface Props {\n  foo: string;\n}\n\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return {this.props.foo}\n  }\n}\n\n; // ok\n; // error\n\n"},"pages/Decorators.html":{"url":"pages/Decorators.html","title":"Decorators","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nWith the introduction of Classes in TypeScript and ES6, there now exist certain scenarios that require additional features to support annotating or modifying classes and class members.\nDecorators provide a way to add both annotations and a meta-programming syntax for class declarations and members.\nDecorators are a stage 2 proposal for JavaScript and are available as an experimental feature of TypeScript.\n\nNOTE  Decorators are an experimental feature that may change in future releases.\n\nTo enable experimental support for decorators, you must enable the experimentalDecorators compiler option either on the command line or in your tsconfig.json:\nCommand Line:\ntsc --target ES5 --experimentalDecorators\n\ntsconfig.json:\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"target\": \"ES5\",\n        \"experimentalDecorators\": true\n    }\n}\n\nDecorators\nA Decorator is a special kind of declaration that can be attached to a class declaration, method, accessor, property, or parameter.\nDecorators use the form @expression, where expression must evaluate to a function that will be called at runtime with information about the decorated declaration.\nFor example, given the decorator @sealed we might write the sealed function as follows:\nfunction sealed(target) {\n    // do something with 'target' ...\n}\n\n\nNOTE  You can see a more detailed example of a decorator in Class Decorators, below.\n\nDecorator Factories\nIf we want to customize how a decorator is applied to a declaration, we can write a decorator factory.\nA Decorator Factory is simply a function that returns the expression that will be called by the decorator at runtime.\nWe can write a decorator factory in the following fashion:\nfunction color(value: string) { // this is the decorator factory\n    return function (target) { // this is the decorator\n        // do something with 'target' and 'value'...\n    }\n}\n\n\nNOTE  You can see a more detailed example of a decorator factory in Method Decorators, below.\n\nDecorator Composition\nMultiple decorators can be applied to a declaration, as in the following examples:\n\nOn a single line:\n@f @g x\n\n\nOn multiple lines:\n@f\n@g\nx\n\n\n\nWhen multiple decorators apply to a single declaration, their evaluation is similar to function composition in mathematics. In this model, when composing functions f and g, the resulting composite (f ∘ g)(x) is equivalent to f(g(x)).\nAs such, the following steps are performed when evaluating multiple decorators on a single declaration in TypeScript:\n\nThe expressions for each decorator are evaluated top-to-bottom.\nThe results are then called as functions from bottom-to-top.\n\nIf we were to use decorator factories, we can observe this evaluation order with the following example:\nfunction f() {\n    console.log(\"f(): evaluated\");\n    return function (target, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {\n        console.log(\"f(): called\");\n    }\n}\n\nfunction g() {\n    console.log(\"g(): evaluated\");\n    return function (target, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {\n        console.log(\"g(): called\");\n    }\n}\n\nclass C {\n    @f()\n    @g()\n    method() {}\n}\n\nWhich would print this output to the console:\nf(): evaluated\ng(): evaluated\ng(): called\nf(): called\n\nDecorator Evaluation\nThere is a well defined order to how decorators applied to various declarations inside of a class are applied:\n\nParameter Decorators, followed by Method, Accessor, or Property Decorators are applied for each instance member.\nParameter Decorators, followed by Method, Accessor, or Property Decorators are applied for each static member.\nParameter Decorators are applied for the constructor.\nClass Decorators are applied for the class.\n\nClass Decorators\nA Class Decorator is declared just before a class declaration.\nThe class decorator is applied to the constructor of the class and can be used to observe, modify, or replace a class definition.\nA class decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, or in any other ambient context (such as on a declare class).\nThe expression for the class decorator will be called as a function at runtime, with the constructor of the decorated class as its only argument.\nIf the class decorator returns a value, it will replace the class declaration with the provided constructor function.\n\nNOTE  Should you chose to return a new constructor function, you must take care to maintain the original prototype.\nThe logic that applies decorators at runtime will not do this for you.\n\nThe following is an example of a class decorator (@sealed) applied to the Greeter class:\n@sealed\nclass Greeter {\n    greeting: string;\n    constructor(message: string) {\n        this.greeting = message;\n    }\n    greet() {\n        return \"Hello, \" + this.greeting;\n    }\n}\n\nWe can define the @sealed decorator using the following function declaration:\nfunction sealed(constructor: Function) {\n    Object.seal(constructor);\n    Object.seal(constructor.prototype);\n}\n\nWhen @sealed is executed, it will seal both the constructor and its prototype.\nNext we have an example of how to override the constructor.\nfunction classDecorator(constructor:T) {\n    return class extends constructor {\n        newProperty = \"new property\";\n        hello = \"override\";\n    }\n}\n\n@classDecorator\nclass Greeter {\n    property = \"property\";\n    hello: string;\n    constructor(m: string) {\n        this.hello = m;\n    }\n}\n\nconsole.log(new Greeter(\"world\"));\n\nMethod Decorators\nA Method Decorator is declared just before a method declaration.\nThe decorator is applied to the Property Descriptor for the method, and can be used to observe, modify, or replace a method definition.\nA method decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, on an overload, or in any other ambient context (such as in a declare class).\nThe expression for the method decorator will be called as a function at runtime, with the following three arguments:\n\nEither the constructor function of the class for a static member, or the prototype of the class for an instance member.\nThe name of the member.\nThe Property Descriptor for the member.\n\n\nNOTE  The Property Descriptor will be undefined if your script target is less than ES5.\n\nIf the method decorator returns a value, it will be used as the Property Descriptor for the method.\n\nNOTE  The return value is ignored if your script target is less than ES5.\n\nThe following is an example of a method decorator (@enumerable) applied to a method on the Greeter class:\nclass Greeter {\n    greeting: string;\n    constructor(message: string) {\n        this.greeting = message;\n    }\n\n    @enumerable(false)\n    greet() {\n        return \"Hello, \" + this.greeting;\n    }\n}\n\nWe can define the @enumerable decorator using the following function declaration:\nfunction enumerable(value: boolean) {\n    return function (target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {\n        descriptor.enumerable = value;\n    };\n}\n\nThe @enumerable(false) decorator here is a decorator factory.\nWhen the @enumerable(false) decorator is called, it modifies the enumerable property of the property descriptor.\nAccessor Decorators\nAn Accessor Decorator is declared just before an accessor declaration.\nThe accessor decorator is applied to the Property Descriptor for the accessor and can be used to observe, modify, or replace an accessor's definitions.\nAn accessor decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, or in any other ambient context (such as in a declare class).\n\nNOTE  TypeScript disallows decorating both the get and set accessor for a single member.\nInstead, all decorators for the member must be applied to the first accessor specified in document order.\nThis is because decorators apply to a Property Descriptor, which combines both the get and set accessor, not each declaration separately.\n\nThe expression for the accessor decorator will be called as a function at runtime, with the following three arguments:\n\nEither the constructor function of the class for a static member, or the prototype of the class for an instance member.\nThe name of the member.\nThe Property Descriptor for the member.\n\n\nNOTE  The Property Descriptor will be undefined if your script target is less than ES5.\n\nIf the accessor decorator returns a value, it will be used as the Property Descriptor for the member.\n\nNOTE  The return value is ignored if your script target is less than ES5.\n\nThe following is an example of an accessor decorator (@configurable) applied to a member of the Point class:\nclass Point {\n    private _x: number;\n    private _y: number;\n    constructor(x: number, y: number) {\n        this._x = x;\n        this._y = y;\n    }\n\n    @configurable(false)\n    get x() { return this._x; }\n\n    @configurable(false)\n    get y() { return this._y; }\n}\n\nWe can define the @configurable decorator using the following function declaration:\nfunction configurable(value: boolean) {\n    return function (target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {\n        descriptor.configurable = value;\n    };\n}\n\nProperty Decorators\nA Property Decorator is declared just before a property declaration.\nA property decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, or in any other ambient context (such as in a declare class).\nThe expression for the property decorator will be called as a function at runtime, with the following two arguments:\n\nEither the constructor function of the class for a static member, or the prototype of the class for an instance member.\nThe name of the member.\n\n\nNOTE  A Property Descriptor is not provided as an argument to a property decorator due to how property decorators are initialized in TypeScript.\nThis is because there is currently no mechanism to describe an instance property when defining members of a prototype, and no way to observe or modify the initializer for a property. The return value is ignored too.\nAs such, a property decorator can only be used to observe that a property of a specific name has been declared for a class.\n\nWe can use this information to record metadata about the property, as in the following example:\nclass Greeter {\n    @format(\"Hello, %s\")\n    greeting: string;\n\n    constructor(message: string) {\n        this.greeting = message;\n    }\n    greet() {\n        let formatString = getFormat(this, \"greeting\");\n        return formatString.replace(\"%s\", this.greeting);\n    }\n}\n\nWe can then define the @format decorator and getFormat functions using the following function declarations:\nimport \"reflect-metadata\";\n\nconst formatMetadataKey = Symbol(\"format\");\n\nfunction format(formatString: string) {\n    return Reflect.metadata(formatMetadataKey, formatString);\n}\n\nfunction getFormat(target: any, propertyKey: string) {\n    return Reflect.getMetadata(formatMetadataKey, target, propertyKey);\n}\n\nThe @format(\"Hello, %s\") decorator here is a decorator factory.\nWhen @format(\"Hello, %s\") is called, it adds a metadata entry for the property using the Reflect.metadata function from the reflect-metadata library.\nWhen getFormat is called, it reads the metadata value for the format.\n\nNOTE  This example requires the reflect-metadata library.\nSee Metadata for more information about the reflect-metadata library.\n\nParameter Decorators\nA Parameter Decorator is declared just before a parameter declaration.\nThe parameter decorator is applied to the function for a class constructor or method declaration.\nA parameter decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, an overload, or in any other ambient context (such as in a declare class).\nThe expression for the parameter decorator will be called as a function at runtime, with the following three arguments:\n\nEither the constructor function of the class for a static member, or the prototype of the class for an instance member.\nThe name of the member.\nThe ordinal index of the parameter in the function's parameter list.\n\n\nNOTE  A parameter decorator can only be used to observe that a parameter has been declared on a method.\n\nThe return value of the parameter decorator is ignored.\nThe following is an example of a parameter decorator (@required) applied to parameter of a member of the Greeter class:\nclass Greeter {\n    greeting: string;\n\n    constructor(message: string) {\n        this.greeting = message;\n    }\n\n    @validate\n    greet(@required name: string) {\n        return \"Hello \" + name + \", \" + this.greeting;\n    }\n}\n\nWe can then define the @required and @validate decorators using the following function declarations:\nimport \"reflect-metadata\";\n\nconst requiredMetadataKey = Symbol(\"required\");\n\nfunction required(target: Object, propertyKey: string | symbol, parameterIndex: number) {\n    let existingRequiredParameters: number[] = Reflect.getOwnMetadata(requiredMetadataKey, target, propertyKey) || [];\n    existingRequiredParameters.push(parameterIndex);\n    Reflect.defineMetadata(requiredMetadataKey, existingRequiredParameters, target, propertyKey);\n}\n\nfunction validate(target: any, propertyName: string, descriptor: TypedPropertyDescriptor) {\n    let method = descriptor.value;\n    descriptor.value = function () {\n        let requiredParameters: number[] = Reflect.getOwnMetadata(requiredMetadataKey, target, propertyName);\n        if (requiredParameters) {\n            for (let parameterIndex of requiredParameters) {\n                if (parameterIndex >= arguments.length || arguments[parameterIndex] === undefined) {\n                    throw new Error(\"Missing required argument.\");\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        return method.apply(this, arguments);\n    }\n}\n\nThe @required decorator adds a metadata entry that marks the parameter as required.\nThe @validate decorator then wraps the existing greet method in a function that validates the arguments before invoking the original method.\n\nNOTE  This example requires the reflect-metadata library.\nSee Metadata for more information about the reflect-metadata library.\n\nMetadata\nSome examples use the reflect-metadata library which adds a polyfill for an experimental metadata API.\nThis library is not yet part of the ECMAScript (JavaScript) standard.\nHowever, once decorators are officially adopted as part of the ECMAScript standard these extensions will be proposed for adoption.\nYou can install this library via npm:\nnpm i reflect-metadata --save\n\nTypeScript includes experimental support for emitting certain types of metadata for declarations that have decorators.\nTo enable this experimental support, you must set the emitDecoratorMetadata compiler option either on the command line or in your tsconfig.json:\nCommand Line:\ntsc --target ES5 --experimentalDecorators --emitDecoratorMetadata\n\ntsconfig.json:\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"target\": \"ES5\",\n        \"experimentalDecorators\": true,\n        \"emitDecoratorMetadata\": true\n    }\n}\n\nWhen enabled, as long as the reflect-metadata library has been imported, additional design-time type information will be exposed at runtime.\nWe can see this in action in the following example:\nimport \"reflect-metadata\";\n\nclass Point {\n    x: number;\n    y: number;\n}\n\nclass Line {\n    private _p0: Point;\n    private _p1: Point;\n\n    @validate\n    set p0(value: Point) { this._p0 = value; }\n    get p0() { return this._p0; }\n\n    @validate\n    set p1(value: Point) { this._p1 = value; }\n    get p1() { return this._p1; }\n}\n\nfunction validate(target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: TypedPropertyDescriptor) {\n    let set = descriptor.set;\n    descriptor.set = function (value: T) {\n        let type = Reflect.getMetadata(\"design:type\", target, propertyKey);\n        if (!(value instanceof type)) {\n            throw new TypeError(\"Invalid type.\");\n        }\n        set(value);\n    }\n}\n\nThe TypeScript compiler will inject design-time type information using the @Reflect.metadata decorator.\nYou could consider it the equivalent of the following TypeScript:\nclass Line {\n    private _p0: Point;\n    private _p1: Point;\n\n    @validate\n    @Reflect.metadata(\"design:type\", Point)\n    set p0(value: Point) { this._p0 = value; }\n    get p0() { return this._p0; }\n\n    @validate\n    @Reflect.metadata(\"design:type\", Point)\n    set p1(value: Point) { this._p1 = value; }\n    get p1() { return this._p1; }\n}\n\n\nNOTE  Decorator metadata is an experimental feature and may introduce breaking changes in future releases.\n\n"},"pages/Mixins.html":{"url":"pages/Mixins.html","title":"Mixins","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nAlong with traditional OO hierarchies, another popular way of building up classes from reusable components is to build them by combining simpler partial classes.\nYou may be familiar with the idea of mixins or traits for languages like Scala, and the pattern has also reached some popularity in the JavaScript community.\nMixin sample\nIn the code below, we show how you can model mixins in TypeScript.\nAfter the code, we'll break down how it works.\n// Disposable Mixin\nclass Disposable {\n    isDisposed: boolean;\n    dispose() {\n        this.isDisposed = true;\n    }\n\n}\n\n// Activatable Mixin\nclass Activatable {\n

[Disposable, Activatable]);\n\nlet smartObj = new SmartObject();\nsetTimeout(() => smartObj.interact(), 1000);\n\n////////////////////////////////////////\n// In your runtime library somewhere\n////////////////////////////////////////\n\nfunction applyMixins(derivedCtor: any, baseCtors: any[]) {\n    baseCtors.forEach(baseCtor => {\n        Object.getOwnPropertyNames(baseCtor.prototype).forEach(name => {\n            derivedCtor.prototype[name] = baseCtor.prototype[name];\n        });\n    });\n}\n\nUnderstanding the sample\nThe code sample starts with the two classes that will act as our mixins.\nYou can see each one is focused on a particular activity or capability.\nWe'll later mix these together to form a new class from both capabilities.\n// Disposable Mixin\nclass Disposable {\n    isDisposed: boolean;\n    dispose() {\n        this.isDisposed = true;\n    }\n\n}\n\n// Activatable Mixin\nclass Activatable {\n    isActive: boolean;\n    activate() {\n        this.isActive = true;\n    }\n    deactivate() {\n        this.isActive = false;\n    }\n}\n\nNext, we'll create the class that will handle the combination of the two mixins.\nLet's look at this in more detail to see how it does this:\nclass SmartObject implements Disposable, Activatable {\n\nThe first thing you may notice in the above is that instead of using extends, we use implements.\nThis treats the classes as interfaces, and only uses the types behind Disposable and Activatable rather than the implementation.\nThis means that we'll have to provide the implementation in class.\nExcept, that's exactly what we want to avoid by using mixins.\nTo satisfy this requirement, we create stand-in properties and their types for the

single-line comments, and hold no special meaning.\n/// \nThe ///  directive is the most common of this group.\nIt serves as a declaration of dependency between files.\nTriple-slash references instruct the compiler to include additional files in the compilation process.\nThey also serve as a method to order the output when using --out or --outFile.\nFiles are emitted to the output file location in the same order as the input after preprocessing pass.\nPreprocessing input files\nThe compiler performs a preprocessing pass on input files to resolve all triple-slash reference directives.\nDuring this process, additional files are added to the compilation.\nThe process starts with a set of root files;\nthese are the file names specified on the command-line or in the \"files\" list in the tsconfig.json file.\nThese root files are preprocessed in the same order they are specified.\nBefore a file is added to the list, all triple-slash references in it are processed,

this directive serves as a declaration of dependency;\na ///  directive, however, declares a dependency on a package.\nThe process of resolving these package names is similar to the process of resolving module names in an import statement.\nAn easy way to think of triple-slash-reference-types directives are as an import for declaration packages.\nFor example, including ///  in a declaration file declares that this file uses names declared in @types/node/index.d.ts;\nand thus, this package needs to be included in the compilation along with the declaration file.\nUse these directives only when you're authoring a d.ts file by hand.\nFor declaration files generated during compilation, the compiler will automatically add ///  for you;\nA ///  in a generated declaration file is added if and only if the resulting file uses any declarations from the referenced package.\nFor declaring a dependency on an @types package in a .ts file, use --types on the command line or in your tsconfig.json instead.\nSee using @types, typeRoots and types in tsconfig.json files for more details.\n/// \nThis directive marks a file as a default library.\nYou will see this comment at the top of lib.d.ts and its different variants.\nThis directive instructs the compiler to not include the default library (i.e. lib.d.ts) in the compilation.\nThe impact here is similar to passing --noLib on the command line.\nAlso note that when passing --skipDefaultLibCheck, the compiler will only skip checking files with /// .\n/// \nBy default AMD modules are generated anonymous.\nThis can lead to problems when other tools are used to process the resulting modules, such as bundlers (e.g. r.js).\nThe amd-module directive allows passing an optional module name to the

For example:\n/** @type {number} */\nvar x;\n\nx = 0;      // OK\nx = false;  // Error: boolean is not assignable to number\n\nYou can find the full list of supported JSDoc patterns in the JSDoc support in JavaScript documentation.\nProperty declaration inferred from assignments in class bodies\nES2015/ES6 does not have a means for declaring properties on classes. Properties are dynamically assigned, just like in the case of object literals. \nIn a .js file property declarations are inferred from assignments to the properties inside the class body. The type of properties is the union of the types of all the right-hand values in these assignments. Properties defined in the constructor are always assumed to exist, where as ones defined in methods, getters, or setters are considered optional.\nAdorn property assignments with JSDoc to specify the type of the property as needed. For instance:\nclass C {\n    constructor() {\n        /** @type {number | undefined} */\n    this.prop = undefined;\n    }\n}\n\n\nlet c = new C();\nc.prop = 0;         // OK\nc.prop = \"string\";  // Error: string is not assignable to number|undefined\n\nIf properties are never set in the class body, they are considered unknown. If your class has properties that are only read from, consider adding an initialization in the constructor to undefined, e.g. this.prop = undefined;.\nCommonJS module input support\nIn a .js files CommonJS module format is allowed as an input module format. Assignments to exports, and module.exports are recognized as export declarations. Similarly, require function calls are recognized as module imports. For example:\n// import module \"fs\"\nconst fs = require(\"fs\");\n\n\n// export function readFile\nmodule.exports.readFile = function(f) {\n    return fs.readFileSync(f);    \n}\n\nObject literals are open-ended\nBy default object literals in variable declarations provide the type of a declaration. No new members can be added that were not specified in the original initialization. This rule is relaxed in a .js file; object literals have an open-ended type, allowing adding and looking up properties that were not defined originally. For instance:\nvar obj = { a: 1 };\nobj.b = 2;  // Allowed\n\nObject literals get a default index signature [x:string]: any that allows them to be treated as open maps instead of closed objects.\nSimilar to other special JS checking behaviors, this behavior can be changed by specifying a JSDoc type for the variable. For example:\n/** @type {{a: number}} */\nvar obj = { a: 1 };\nobj.b = 2;  // Error, type {a: number} does not have property b\n\nFunction parameters are optional by default\nSince there is no way to specify optionality on parameters in JS (without specifying a default value), all function parameters in .js file are considered optional. Calls with fewer arguments are allowed. \nIt is important to note that it is an error to call a function with too many arguments.\nFor instance:\nfunction bar(a, b){\n    console.log(a + \" \" + b);\n}\n\nbar(1);       // OK, second argument considered optional\nbar(1, 2);\nbar(1, 2, 3); // Error, too many arguments\n\nJSDoc annotated functions are excluded from this rule. Use JSDoc optional parameter syntax to express optionality. e.g.:\n/**\n * @param {string} [somebody] - Somebody's name.\n */\nfunction sayHello(somebody) {\n    if (!somebody) {\n        somebody = 'John Doe';\n    }\n    alert('Hello ' + somebody);\n}\n\nsayHello();\n\nVar-args parameter declaration inferred from use of arguments\nA function whose body has a reference to the arguments reference is implicitly considered to have a var-arg parameter (i.e. (...arg: any[]) => any). Use JSDoc var-arg syntax to specify the type of the arguments.\nUnspecified type parameters default to any\nAn unspecified generic type parameter defaults to any. There are few places where this happens:\nIn extends clause:\nFor instance, React.Component is defined to have two generic type parameters, Props and State. \nIn a .js file, there is no legal way to specify these in the extends clause. By default the type arguments will be any:\nimport { Component } from \"react\";\n\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n    render() {\n       this.props.b; // Allowed, since this.props is of type any\n    }\n}\n\nUse JSDoc @augments to specify the types explicitly. for instance:\nimport { Component } from \"react\";\n\n/**\n * @augments {Component}\n */\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n    render() {\n        this.props.b; // Error: b does not exist on {a:number}\n    }\n}\n\nIn JSDoc references\nAn unspecified generic type argument in JSDoc defaults to any:\n/** @type{Array} */\nvar x = [];\n\nx.push(1);        // OK\nx.push(\"string\"); // OK, x is of type Array\n\n\n/** @type{Array.} */\nvar y = [];\n\ny.push(1);        // OK\ny.push(\"string\"); // Error, string is not assignable to number\n\nIn function calls\nA call to generic functions uses arguments to infer the generic type parameters. Sometimes this process fails to infer any types, mainly because of lack on inference sources; in these cases, the generic type parameters will default to any. For example:\nvar p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { reject() });\n\np; // Promise;\n\n"},"pages/declaration files/Introduction.html":{"url":"pages/declaration

Structures.html":{"url":"pages/declaration files/Library Structures.html","title":"Library Structures","keywords":"","body":"Overview\nBroadly speaking, the way you structure your declaration file depends on how the library is consumed.\nThere are many ways of offering a library for consumption in JavaScript, and you'll need to write your declaration file to match it.\nThis guide covers how to identify common library patterns, and how to write declaration files which correspond to that pattern.\nEach type of major library structuring pattern has a corresponding file in the Templates section.\nYou can start with these templates to help you get going faster.\nIdentifying Kinds of Libraries\nFirst, we'll review the kinds of libraries TypeScript declaration files can represent.\nWe'll briefly show how each kind of library is used, how it is written, and list some example libraries from the real world.\nIdentifying the structure of a library is the first step in writing its declaration file.\nWe'll give hints on how to identify structure both based on its usage and its code.\nDepending on the library's documentation and organization, one might be easier than the other.\nWe recommend using whichever is more comfortable to you.\nGlobal Libraries\nA global library is one that can be accessed from the global scope (i.e. without using any form of import).\nMany libraries simply expose one or more global variables for use.\nFor example, if you were using jQuery, the $ variable can be used by simply referring to it:\n$(() => { console.log('hello!'); } );\n\nYou'll usually see guidance in the documentation of a global library of how to use the library in an HTML script tag:\n\n\nToday, most popular globally-accessible libraries are actually written as UMD libraries (see below).\nUMD library documentation is hard to distinguish from global library documentation.\nBefore writing a global declaration file, make sure the library isn't actually UMD.\nIdentifying a Global Library from Code\nGlobal library code is usually extremely simple.\nA global \"Hello, world\" library might look like this:\nfunction createGreeting(s) {\n    return \"Hello, \" + s;\n}\n\nor like this:\nwindow.createGreeting = function(s) {\n    return \"Hello, \" + s;\n}\n\nWhen looking at the code of a global library, you'll usually see:\n\nTop-level var statements or function declarations\nOne or more assignments to window.someName\nAssumptions that DOM primitives like document or window exist\n\nYou won't see:\n\nChecks for, or usage of, module loaders like require or define\nCommonJS/Node.js-style imports of the form var fs = require(\"fs\");\nCalls to define(...)\nDocumentation describing how to require or import the library\n\nExamples of Global Libraries\nBecause it's usually easy to turn a global library into a UMD library, very few popular libraries are still written in the global style.\nHowever, libraries that are small and require the DOM (or have no dependencies) may still be global.\nGlobal Library Template\nThe template file global.d.ts defines an example library myLib.\nBe sure to read the \"Preventing Name Conflicts\" footnote.\nModular Libraries\nSome libraries only work in a module loader environment.\nFor example, because express only works in Node.js and must be loaded using the CommonJS require function.\nECMAScript 2015 (also known as ES2015, ECMAScript 6, and ES6), CommonJS, and RequireJS have similar notions of importing a module.\nIn JavaScript CommonJS (Node.js), for example, you would write\nvar fs = require(\"fs\");\n\nIn TypeScript or ES6, the import keyword serves the same purpose:\nimport fs = require(\"fs\");\n\nYou'll typically see modular libraries include one of these lines in their documentation:\nvar someLib = require('someLib');\n\nor\ndefine(..., ['someLib'], function(someLib) {\n\n});\n\nAs with global modules, you might see these examples in the documentation of a UMD module, so be sure to check the code or documentation.\nIdentifying a Module Library from Code\nModular libraries will typically have at least some of the following:\n\nUnconditional calls to require or define\nDeclarations like import * as a from 'b'; or export c;\nAssignments to exports or module.exports\n\nThey will rarely have:\n\nAssignments to properties of window or global\n\nExamples of Modular Libraries\nMany popular Node.js libraries are in the module family, such as express, gulp, and request.\nUMD\nA UMD module is one that can either be used as module (through an import), or as a global (when run in an environment without a module loader).\nMany popular libraries, such as Moment.js, are written this way.\nFor example, in Node.js or using RequireJS, you would write:\nimport moment = require(\"moment\");\nconsole.log(moment.format());\n\nwhereas in a vanilla browser environment you would write:\nconsole.log(moment.format());\n\nIdentifying a UMD library\nUMD modules check for the existence of a module loader environment.\nThis is an easy-to-spot pattern that looks something like this:\n(function (root, factory) {\n    if (typeof define === \"function\" && define.amd) {\n        define([\"libName\"], factory);\n    } else if (typeof module === \"object\" && module.exports) {\n        module.exports = factory(require(\"libName\"));\n    } else {\n        root.returnExports = factory(root.libName);\n    }\n}(this, function (b) {\n\nIf you see tests for typeof define, typeof window, or typeof module in the code of a library, especially at the top of the file, it's almost always a UMD library.\nDocumentation for UMD libraries will also often demonstrate a \"Using in Node.js\" example showing require,\n  and a \"Using in the browser\" example showing using a  tag to load the script.\nExamples of UMD libraries\nMost popular libraries are now available as UMD packages.\nExamples include jQuery, Moment.js, lodash, and many more.\nTemplate\nThere are three templates available for modules,\n  module.d.ts, module-class.d.ts and module-function.d.ts.\nUse module-function.d.ts if your module can be called like a function:\nvar x = require(\"foo\");\n// Note: calling 'x' as a function\nvar y = x(42);\n\nBe sure to read the footnote \"The Impact of ES6 on Module Call Signatures\"\nUse module-class.d.ts if your module can be constructed using new:\nvar x = require(\"bar\");\n// Note: using 'new' operator on the imported variable\nvar y = new x(\"hello\");\n\nThe same footnote applies to these modules.\nIf your module is not callable or constructable, use the module.d.ts file.\nModule Plugin or UMD Plugin\nA module plugin changes the shape of another module (either UMD or module).\nFor example, in Moment.js, moment-range adds a new range method to the moment object.\nFor the purposes of writing a declaration file, you'll write the same code whether the module being changed is a plain module or UMD module.\nTemplate\nUse the module-plugin.d.ts template.\nGlobal Plugin\nA global plugin is global code that changes the shape of some global.\nAs with global-modifying modules, these raise the possibility of runtime conflict.\nFor example, some libraries add new functions to Array.prototype or String.prototype.\nIdentifying global plugins\nGlobal plugins are generally easy to identify from their documentation.\nYou'll see examples that look like this:\nvar x = \"hello, world\";\n// Creates new methods on built-in types\nconsole.log(x.startsWithHello());\n\nvar y = [1, 2, 3];\n// Creates new methods on built-in types\nconsole.log(y.reverseAndSort());\n\nTemplate\nUse the global-plugin.d.ts template.\nGlobal-modifying Modules\nA global-modifying module alters existing values in the global scope when they are imported.\nFor example, there might exist a library which adds new members to String.prototype when imported.\nThis pattern is somewhat dangerous due to the possibility of runtime conflicts,\n  but we can still write a declaration file for it.\nIdentifying global-modifying modules\nGlobal-modifying modules are generally easy to identify from their documentation.\nIn general, they're similar to global plugins, but need a require call to activate their effects.\nYou might see documentation like this:\n// 'require' call that doesn't use its return value\nvar unused = require(\"magic-string-time\");\n/* or */\nrequire(\"magic-string-time\");\n\nvar x = \"hello, world\";\n// Creates new methods on built-in types\nconsole.log(x.startsWithHello());\n\nvar y = [1, 2, 3];\n// Creates new methods on built-in types\nconsole.log(y.reverseAndSort());\n\nTemplate\nUse the global-modifying-module.d.ts template.\nConsuming Dependencies\nThere are several kinds of dependencies you might have.\nDependencies on Global Libraries\nIf your library depends on a global library, use a ///  directive:\n/// \n\nfunction getThing(): someLib.thing;\n\nDependencies on Modules\nIf your library depends on a module, use an import statement:\nimport * as moment from \"moment\";\n\nfunction getThing(): moment;\n\nDependencies on UMD libraries\nFrom a Global Library\nIf your global library depends on a UMD module, use a ///  directive:\n/// \n\nfunction getThing(): moment;\n\nFrom a Module or UMD Library\nIf your module or UMD library depends on a UMD library, use an import statement:\nimport * as someLib from 'someLib';\n\nDo not use a ///  directive to declare a dependency to a UMD library!\nFootnotes\nPreventing Name Conflicts\nNote that it's possible to define many types in the global scope when writing a global declaration file.\nWe strongly discourage this as it leads to possible unresolvable name conflicts when many declaration files are in a project.\nA simple rule to follow is to only declare types namespaced by whatever global variable the library defines.\nFor example, if the library defines the global value 'cats', you should write\ndeclare namespace cats {\n    interface KittySettings { }\n}\n\nBut not\n// at top-level\ninterface CatsKittySettings { }\n\nThis guidance also ensures that the library can be transitioned to UMD without breaking declaration file users.\nThe Impact of ES6 on Module Plugins\nSome plugins add or modify top-level exports on existing modules.\nWhile this is legal in CommonJS and other loaders, ES6 modules are considered immutable and this pattern will not be possible.\nBecause TypeScript is loader-agnostic, there is no compile-time enforcement of this policy, but developers intending to transition to an ES6 module loader should be aware of this.\nThe Impact of ES6 on Module Call Signatures\nMany popular libraries, such as Express, expose themselves as a callable function when imported.\nFor example, the typical Express usage looks like this:\nimport exp = require(\"express\");\nvar app = exp();\n\nIn ES6 module loaders, the top-level object (here imported as exp) can only have properties;\n  the top-level module object is never callable.\nThe most common solution here is to define a default export for a callable/constructable object;\n  some module loader shims will automatically detect this situation and replace the top-level object with the default export.\n"},"pages/declaration files/By Example.html":{"url":"pages/declaration files/By Example.html","title":"By Example","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nThe purpose of this guide is to

will be ignored:\n/* WRONG */\nfunction fn(x: () => any) {\n    x();\n}\n\nDo use the return type void for callbacks whose value will be ignored:\n/* OK */\nfunction fn(x: () => void) {\n    x();\n}\n\nWhy: Using void is safer because it prevents you from accidently using the return value of x in an unchecked way:\nfunction fn(x: () => void) {\n    var k = x(); // oops! meant to do something else\n    k.doSomething(); // error, but would be OK if the return type had been 'any'\n}\n\nOptional Parameters in Callbacks\nDon't use optional parameters in callbacks unless you really mean it:\n/* WRONG */\ninterface Fetcher {\n    getObject(done: (data: any, elapsedTime?: number) => void): void;\n}\n\nThis has a very specific meaning: the done callback might be invoked with 1 argument or might be invoked with 2 arguments.\nThe author probably intended to say that the callback might not care about the elapsedTime parameter,\n  but there's no need to make the parameter optional to accomplish this --\n  it's always legal to provide a callback that accepts fewer arguments.\nDo write callback parameters as non-optional:\n/* OK */\ninterface Fetcher {\n    getObject(done: (data: any, elapsedTime: number) => void): void;\n}\n\nOverloads and Callbacks\nDon't write separate overloads that differ only on callback arity:\n/* WRONG */\ndeclare function beforeAll(action: () => void, timeout?: number): void;\ndeclare function beforeAll(action: (done: DoneFn) => void, timeout?: number): void;\n\nDo write a single overload using the maximum arity:\n/* OK */\ndeclare function beforeAll(action: (done: DoneFn) => void, timeout?: number): void;\n\nWhy: It's always legal for a callback to disregard a parameter, so there's no need for the shorter overload.\nProviding a shorter callback first allows incorrectly-typed functions to be passed in because they match the first overload.\nFunction Overloads\nOrdering\nDon't put more general overloads before more specific overloads:\n/* WRONG */\ndeclare function fn(x: any): any;\ndeclare function fn(x: HTMLElement): number;\ndeclare function fn(x: HTMLDivElement): string;\n\nvar myElem: HTMLDivElement;\nvar x = fn(myElem); // x: any, wat?\n\nDo sort overloads by putting the more general signatures after more specific signatures:\n/* OK */\ndeclare function fn(x: HTMLDivElement): string;\ndeclare function fn(x: HTMLElement): number;\ndeclare function fn(x: any): any;\n\nvar myElem: HTMLDivElement;\nvar x = fn(myElem); // x: string, :)\n\nWhy: TypeScript chooses the first matching overload when resolving function calls.\nWhen an earlier overload is \"more general\" than a later one, the later one is effectively hidden and cannot be called.\nUse Optional Parameters\nDon't write several overloads that differ only in trailing parameters:\n/* WRONG */\ninterface Example {\n    diff(one: string): number;\n    diff(one: string, two: string): number;\n    diff(one: string, two: string, three: boolean): number;\n}\n\nDo use optional parameters whenever possible:\n/* OK */\ninterface Example {\n    diff(one: string, two?: string, three?: boolean): number;\n}\n\nNote that this collapsing should only occur when all overloads have the same return type.\nWhy: This is important for two reasons.\nTypeScript resolves signature compatibility by seeing if any signature of the target can be invoked with the arguments of the source,\n  and extraneous arguments are allowed.\nThis code, for example, exposes a bug only when the signature is correctly written using optional parameters:\nfunction fn(x: (a: string, b: number, c: number) => void) { }\nvar x: Example;\n// When written with overloads, OK -- used first overload\n// When written with optionals, correctly an error\nfn(x.diff);\n\nThe second reason is when a consumer uses the \"strict null checking\" feature of TypeScript.\nBecause unspecified parameters appear as undefined in JavaScript, it's usually fine to pass an explicit undefined to a function with optional arguments.\nThis code, for example, should be OK under strict nulls:\nvar x: Example;\n// When written with overloads, incorrectly an error because of passing 'undefined' to 'string'\n// When written with optionals, correctly OK\nx.diff(\"something\", true ? undefined : \"hour\");\n\nUse Union Types\nDon't write overloads that differ by type in only one argument position:\n/* WRONG */\ninterface Moment {\n    utcOffset(): number;\n    utcOffset(b: number): Moment;\n    utcOffset(b: string): Moment;\n}\n\nDo use union types whenever possible:\n/* OK */\ninterface Moment {\n    utcOffset(): number;\n    utcOffset(b: number|string): Moment;\n}\n\nNote that we didn't make b optional here because the return types of the signatures differ.\nWhy: This is important for people who are \"passing through\" a value to your function:\nfunction fn(x: string): void;\nfunction fn(x: number): void;\nfunction fn(x: number|string) {\n    // When written with separate overloads, incorrectly an error\n    // When written with union types, correctly OK\n    return moment().utcOffset(x);\n}\n\n"},"pages/declaration files/Deep Dive.html":{"url":"pages/declaration files/Deep Dive.html","title":"Deep Dive","keywords":"","body":"Definition File Theory: A Deep Dive\nStructuring modules to give the exact API shape you want can be tricky.\nFor example, we might want a module that can be invoked with or without new to produce different types,\n  has a variety of named types exposed in a hierarchy,\n  and has some properties on the module object as well.\nBy reading this guide, you'll have the tools to write complex definition files that expose a friendly API surface.\nThis guide focuses on module (or UMD) libraries because the options here are more varied.\nKey Concepts\nYou can fully understand how to make any shape of definition\n  by understanding some key concepts of how TypeScript works.\nTypes\nIf you're reading this guide, you probably already roughly know what a type in TypeScript is.\nTo be more explicit, though, a type is introduced with:\n\nA type alias declaration (type sn = number | string;)\nAn interface declaration (interface I { x: number[]; })\nA class declaration (class C { })\nAn enum declaration (enum E { A, B, C })\nAn import declaration which refers to a type\n\nEach of these declaration forms creates a new type name.\nValues\nAs with types, you probably already understand what a value is.\nValues are runtime names that we can reference in expressions.\nFor example let x = 5; creates a value called x.\nAgain, being explicit, the following things create values:\n\nlet, const, and var declarations\nA namespace or module declaration which contains a value\nAn enum declaration\nA class declaration\nAn import declaration which refers to a value\nA function declaration\n\nNamespaces\nTypes can exist in namespaces.\nFor example, if we have the declaration let x: A.B.C,\n  we say that the type C comes from the A.B namespace.\nThis distinction is subtle and important -- here, A.B is not necessarily a type or a value.\nSimple Combinations: One name, multiple meanings\nGiven a name A, we might find up to three different meanings for A: a type, a value or a namespace.\nHow the name is interpreted depends on the context in which it is used.\nFor example, in the declaration let m: A.A = A;,\n  A is used first as a namespace, then as a type name, then as a value.\nThese meanings might end up referring to entirely different declarations!\nThis may seem confusing, but it's actually very convenient as long as we don't excessively overload things.\nLet's look at some useful aspects of this combining behavior.\nBuilt-in Combinations\nAstute readers will notice that, for example, class appeared in both the type and value lists.\nThe declaration class C { } creates two things:\n  a type C which refers to the instance shape of the class,\n  and a value C which refers to the constructor function of the class.\nEnum declarations behave similarly.\nUser Combinations\nLet's say we wrote a module file foo.d.ts:\nexport var SomeVar: { a: SomeType };\nexport interface SomeType {\n  count: number;\n}\n\nThen consumed it:\nimport * as foo from './foo';\nlet x: foo.SomeType = foo.SomeVar.a;\nconsole.log(x.count);\n\nThis works well enough, but we might imagine that SomeType and SomeVar were very closely related\n  such that you'd like them to have the same name.\nWe can use combining to present these two different objects (the value and the type) under the same name Bar:\nexport var Bar: { a: Bar };\nexport interface Bar {\n  count: number;\n}\n\nThis presents a very good opportunity for destructuring in the consuming code:\nimport { Bar } from './foo';\nlet x: Bar = Bar.a;\nconsole.log(x.count);\n\nAgain, we've used Bar as both a type and a value here.\nNote that we didn't have to declare the Bar value as being of the Bar type -- they're independent.\nAdvanced Combinations\nSome kinds of declarations can be combined across multiple declarations.\nFor example, class C { } and interface C { } can co-exist and both contribute properties to the C types.\nThis is legal as long as it does not create a conflict.\nA general rule of thumb is that values always conflict with other values of the same name unless they are declared as namespaces,\n  types will conflict if they are declared with a type alias declaration (type s = string),\n  and namespaces never conflict.\nLet's see how this can be used.\nAdding using an interface\nWe can add additional members to an interface with another interface declaration:\ninterface Foo {\n  x: number;\n}\n// ... elsewhere ...\ninterface Foo {\n  y: number;\n}\nlet a: Foo = ...;\nconsole.log(a.x + a.y); // OK\n\nThis also works with classes:\nclass Foo {\n  x: number;\n}\n// ... elsewhere ...\ninterface Foo {\n  y: number;\n}\nlet a: Foo = ...;\nconsole.log(a.x + a.y); // OK\n\nNote that we cannot add to type aliases (type s = string;) using an interface.\nAdding using a namespace\nA namespace declaration can be used to add new types, values, and namespaces in any way which does not create a conflict.\nFor example, we can add a static member to a class:\nclass C {\n}\n// ... elsewhere ...\nnamespace C {\n  export let x: number;\n}\nlet y = C.x; // OK\n\nNote that in this example, we added a value to the static side of C (its constructor function).\nThis is because we added a value, and the container for all values is another value\n  (types are contained by namespaces, and namespaces are contained by other namespaces).\nWe could also add a namespaced type to a class:\nclass C {\n}\n// ... elsewhere ...\nnamespace C {\n  export interface D { }\n}\nlet y: C.D; // OK\n\nIn this example, there wasn't a namespace C until we wrote the namespace declaration for it.\nThe meaning C as a namespace doesn't conflict with the value or type meanings of C created by the class.\nFinally, we could perform many different merges using namespace declarations.\nThis isn't a particularly realistic example, but shows all sorts of interesting behavior:\nnamespace X {\n  export interface Y { }\n  export class Z { }\n}\n\n// ... elsewhere ...\nnamespace X {\n  export var Y: number;\n  export namespace Z {\n    export class C { }\n  }\n}\ntype X = string;\n\nIn this example, the first block creates the following name meanings:\n\nA value X (because the namespace declaration contains a value, Z)\nA namespace X (because the namespace declaration contains a type, Y)\nA type Y in the X namespace\nA type Z in the X namespace (the instance shape of the class)\nA value Z that is a property of the X value (the constructor function of the class)\n\nThe second  block creates the following name meanings:\n\nA value Y (of type number) that is a property of the X value\nA namespace Z\nA value Z that is a property of the X value\nA type C in the X.Z namespace\nA value C that is a property of the X.Z value\nA type X\n\nUsing with export = or import\nAn important rule is that export and import declarations export or import all meanings of their targets.\n\n"},"pages/declaration files/Templates.html":{"url":"pages/declaration

is time to publish it to npm.\nThere are two main ways you can publish your declaration files to npm:\n\nbundling with your npm package, or\npublishing to the @types organization on npm.\n\nIf your package is written in TypeScript then the first approach is favored.\nUse the --declaration flag to generate declaration files.\nThis way, your declarations and JavaScript always be in sync.\nIf your package is not written in TypeScript then the second is the prefered approch.\nIncluding declarations in your npm package\nIf your package has a main .js file, you will need to indicate the main declaration file in your package.json file as well.\nSet the types property to point to your bundled declaration file.\nFor example:\n{\n    \"name\": \"awesome\",\n    \"author\": \"Vandelay Industries\",\n    \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n    \"main\": \"./lib/main.js\",\n    \"types\": \"./lib/main.d.ts\"\n}\n\nNote that the \"typings\" field is synonymous with \"types\", and could be used as well.\nAlso note that if your main declaration file is named index.d.ts and lives at the root of the package (next to index.js) you do not need to mark the \"types\" property, though it is advisable to do so.\nDependencies\nAll dependencies are managed by npm.\nMake sure all the declaration packages you depend on are marked appropriately in the \"dependencies\" section in your package.json.\nFor example, imagine we authored a package that used Browserify and TypeScript.\n{\n    \"name\": \"browserify-typescript-extension\",\n    \"author\": \"Vandelay Industries\",\n    \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n    \"main\": \"./lib/main.js\",\n    \"types\": \"./lib/main.d.ts\",\n    \"dependencies\": {\n        \"browserify\": \"latest\",\n        \"@types/browserify\": \"latest\",\n        \"typescript\": \"next\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere, our package depends on the browserify and typescript packages.\nbrowserify does not bundle its declaration files with its npm packages, so we needed to depend on @types/browserify for its declarations.\ntypescript, on the other hand, packages its declaration files, so there was no need for any additional dependencies\nOur package exposes declarations from each of those, so any user of our browserify-typescript-extension package needs to have these dependencies as well.\nFor that reason, we used \"dependencies\" and not \"devDependencies\", because otherwise our consumers would have needed to manually install those packages.\nIf we had just written a command line application and not expected our package to be used as a library, we might have used devDependencies.\nRed flags\n/// \nDon't use ///  in your declaration files.\n/// \n....\n\nDo use ///  instead.\n/// \n....\n\nMake sure to revisit the Consuming dependencies section for more information.\nPackaging dependent declarations\nIf your type definitions depend on another package:\n\nDon't combine it with yours, keep each in their own file.\nDon't copy the declarations in your package either.\nDo depend on the npm type declaration package if it doesn't package its declaration files.\n\nPublish to @types\nPackages on under the @types organization are published automatically from DefinitelyTyped using the types-publisher tool.\nTo get your declarations published as an @types package, please submit a pull request to https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped.\nYou can find more details in the contribution guidelines page.\n"},"pages/declaration files/Consumption.html":{"url":"pages/declaration

page details exactly how to do all three.\nDownloading\nGetting type declarations in TypeScript 2.0 and above requires no tools apart from npm.\nAs an example, getting the declarations for a library like lodash takes nothing more than the following command\nnpm install --save @types/lodash\n\nIt is worth noting that if the npm package already includes its declaration file as described in Publishing, downloading the corresponding @types package is not needed.\nConsuming\nFrom there you’ll be able to use lodash in your TypeScript code with no fuss.\nThis works for both modules and global code.\nFor example, once you’ve npm install-ed your type declarations, you can use imports and write\nimport * as _ from \"lodash\";\n_.padStart(\"Hello TypeScript!\", 20, \" \");\n\nor if you’re not using modules, you can just use the global variable _.\n_.padStart(\"Hello TypeScript!\", 20, \" \");\n\nSearching\nFor the most part, type declaration packages should always have the same name as the package name on npm, but prefixed with @types/,\n  but if you need, you can check out https://aka.ms/types to find the package for your favorite library.\n\nNote: if the declaration file you are searching for is not present, you can always contribute one back and help out the next developer looking for it.\nPlease see the DefinitelyTyped contribution guidelines page for

See our full list of supported Compiler Options.\nThe \"files\" property takes a list of relative or absolute file paths.\nThe \"include\" and \"exclude\" properties take a list of glob-like file patterns.\nThe supported glob wildcards are:\n\n* matches zero or more characters (excluding directory separators)\n? matches any one character (excluding directory separators)\n**/ recursively matches any subdirectory\n\nIf a segment of a glob pattern includes only * or .*, then only files with supported extensions are included (e.g. .ts, .tsx, and .d.ts by default with .js and .jsx if allowJs is set to true).\nIf the \"files\" and \"include\" are both left unspecified, the compiler defaults to including all TypeScript (.ts, .d.ts and .tsx) files in the containing directory and subdirectories except those excluded using the \"exclude\" property. JS files (.js and .jsx) are also included if allowJs is set to true.\nIf the \"files\" or \"include\" properties are specified, the compiler will instead include the union of the files included by those two properties.\nFiles in the directory specified using the \"outDir\" compiler option are excluded as long as \"exclude\" property is not specfied. \nFiles included using \"include\" can be filtered using the \"exclude\" property.\nHowever, files included explicitly using the \"files\" property are always included regardless of \"exclude\".\nThe \"exclude\" property defaults to excluding the node_modules, bower_components, jspm_packages and  directories when not specified.\nAny files that are referenced by files included via the \"files\" or \"include\" properties are also included.\nSimilarly, if a file B.ts is referenced by another file A.ts, then B.ts cannot be excluded unless the referencing file A.ts is also specified in the \"exclude\" list.\nPlease note that the compiler does not include files that can be possible outputs; e.g. if the input includes index.ts, then index.d.ts and index.js are excluded.\nIn general, having files that differ only in extension next to each other is not recomended.\nA tsconfig.json file is permitted to be completely empty, which compiles all files included by default (as described above) with the default compiler options.\nCompiler options specified on the command line override those specified in the tsconfig.json file.\n@types, typeRoots and types\nBy default all visible \"@types\" packages are included in your compilation.\nPackages in node_modules/@types of any enclosing folder are considered visible;\nspecifically, that means packages within ./node_modules/@types/,  ../node_modules/@types/, ../../node_modules/@types/, and so on.\nIf typeRoots is specified, only packages under typeRoots will be included.\nFor example:\n{\n   \"compilerOptions\": {\n       \"typeRoots\" : [\"./typings\"]\n   }\n}\n\nThis config file will include all packages under ./typings, and no packages from ./node_modules/@types.\nIf types is specified, only packages listed will be included.\nFor instance:\n{\n   \"compilerOptions\": {\n       \"types\" : [\"node\", \"lodash\", \"express\"]\n   }\n}\n\nThis tsconfig.json file will only include  ./node_modules/@types/node, ./node_modules/@types/lodash and ./node_modules/@types/express.\nOther packages under node_modules/@types/* will not be included. \nA types package is a folder with a file called index.d.ts or a folder with a package.json that has a types field.\nSpecify \"types\": [] to disable automatic inclusion of @types packages.\nKeep in mind that automatic inclusion is only important if you're using files with global declarations (as opposed to files declared as modules).\nIf you use an import \"foo\" statement, for instance, TypeScript may still look through node_modules & node_modules/@types folders to find the foo package.\nConfiguration inheritance with extends\nA tsconfig.json file can inherit configurations from another file using the extends property.\nThe extends is a top-level property in tsconfig.json (alongside compilerOptions, files, include, and exclude).\nextends' value is a string containing a path to another configuration file to inherit from.\nThe configuration from the base file are loaded first, then overridden by those  in the inheriting config file.\nIf a circularity is encountered, we report an error.\nfiles, include and exclude from the inheriting config file overwrite those from the base config file.\nAll relative paths found in the configuration file will be resolved relative to the configuration file they originated in.\nFor example:\nconfigs/base.json:\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"noImplicitAny\": true,\n    \"strictNullChecks\": true\n  }\n}\n\ntsconfig.json:\n{\n  \"extends\": \"./configs/base\",\n  \"files\": [\n    \"main.ts\",\n    \"supplemental.ts\"\n  ]\n}\n\ntsconfig.nostrictnull.json:\n{\n  \"extends\": \"./tsconfig\",\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"strictNullChecks\": false\n  }\n}\n\ncompileOnSave\nSetting a top-level property compileOnSave signals to the IDE to generate all files for a given tsconfig.json upon saving.\n{\n   \"compileOnSave\": true,\n   \"compilerOptions\": {\n       \"noImplicitAny\" : true\n   }\n}\n\nThis feature is currently supported in Visual Studio 2015 with TypeScript 1.8.4 and above, and atom-typescript plugin.\nSchema\nSchema can be found at: http://json.schemastore.org/tsconfig\n"},"pages/Compiler Options.html":{"url":"pages/Compiler Options.html","title":"Compiler Options","keywords":"","body":"Compiler Options\n\n\n\nOption\nType\nDefault\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n--allowJs\nboolean\nfalse\nAllow JavaScript files to be compiled.\n\n\n--allowSyntheticDefaultImports\nboolean\nmodule === \"system\"\nAllow default imports from modules with no default export.

there.\nToolsVersion\nThe value of 1.7 property in the project file identifies the compiler version to use to build (1.7 in this example).\nThis allows a project to build against the same versions of the compiler on different machines.\nIf TypeScriptToolsVersion is not specified, the latest compiler version installed on the machine will be used to build.\nUsers using newer versions of TS, will see a prompt to upgrade their project on first load.\nTypeScriptCompileBlocked\nIf you are using a different build tool to build your project (e.g. gulp, grunt , etc.) and VS for the development and debugging experience, set true in your project.\nThis should give you all the editing support, but not the build when you hit F5.\n"},"pages/Integrating with Build
